<h2><a id="Foreword"></a>Foreword</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> career of the little one-eyed, one-armed
man who frustrated Napoleon’s ambitious
maritime plans for the subjugation of England,
who is to sailors what Napoleon is to soldiers, who
represented in his person all that sea power meant
when the very existence of our forefathers was threatened
in the latter days of the eighteenth century and the
first half-decade of its successor, must ever appeal to
those for whom Great Britain means something more
than a splash of red on a coloured map.</p>

<p>I do not wish to suggest that his fame is insular.
On the contrary, it is universal. Other lands and
other peoples share in our admiration of him. We
must not forget that it was an American naval officer,
Admiral Mahan, who first gave us a really great book
about this truly great man. In his “Life of Nelson,”
we have the hero’s career reviewed by an expert whose
knowledge of tactics has not blinded him to the more
romantic aspects of Nelson’s forty-seven years of life.
Before its appearance readers were dependent upon
the facts and fancies of the biography by Clarke and
McArthur, the “Memoirs” of Pettigrew, or the stirring
but often inaccurate pictures of Southey. The seven
substantial tomes of “Nelson’s Letters and Despatches,”
edited with indefatigable industry by Sir Harris Nicolas,
were not compiled for the general public, although
they have furnished much material for later historians
and must necessarily be the foundation of every modern
book on Nelson.</p>

<p>On our own side of the Atlantic there is no more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
eminent authority than Sir J. Knox Laughton, Litt.D.,
Professor of Modern History at King’s College,
London. He has not only epitomised Nicolas’s work,
but added to our knowledge by his excellent “Nelson”
(English Men of Action Series), “Nelson and his
Companions in Arms,” and “From Howard to Nelson.”
His numerous miscellaneous contributions to the
subject are also of great interest to the serious
student.</p>

<p>Although there is no Nelson cult like that which is
associated with the memory of Napoleon, England’s
great sailor has inspired a considerable literature, as
even the shelves of my own library bear witness. There
are works on his career as a whole, the campaigns
associated with his name, his relations with Lady
Hamilton, and so on. The only excuse I can offer for
adding to the list is, I hope, a valid one. It seems to
me that Nelson’s life, told in his own words as much
as possible, would specially appeal to the young, and
there is, so far as I am aware, no book which does this
in the simple manner which I deem to be necessary.
For help in carrying out my plan of writing a volume
of the kind indicated I am particularly indebted to
Nicolas’s “Letters” and Prof. Sir J. Knox Laughton’s
edition of them.</p>

<p>For good or evil the name of Emma, Lady Hamilton,
is inextricably associated with that of Nelson. Many
and varied have been the attempts to whitewash the
character of her whom he regarded as “one of the
very best women in the world.” While it is difficult
to associate the possessor of the beauty which appealed
with such irresistible force to such painters as Romney,
Reynolds, Lawrence, and Madame Vigée Le Brun, with
“a most inherent baseness,” it is an indisputable fact
that she exercised an adverse influence on Nelson’s
career. Her humble origin, her loveliness, her poses,
her attempts at statecraft, above all, her connection
with the great sailor, have made her the subject of
almost innumerable volumes. For those who wish to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
read an impartial study I would recommend Mr Walter
Sichel’s “Emma, Lady Hamilton.”</p>

<p>Nelson’s written communications are not studied
literary efforts, but spontaneous expressions of his
inmost thoughts. For these reasons they are of inestimable
value in an attempt to sum up his life and aims.
The kindest of men, he sometimes chose to mix vitriol
with his ink. He wrote what he meant, and it was
always very much to the point. Less eminent folk
have sometimes disguised what they thought and
written what they imagined would please. Such was
never Nelson’s way.</p>

<p>“This high man with a great thing to pursue,”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> was
never a trifler. He recognised the importance of a
supreme navy and the supreme importance of its <em>personnel</em>.
He watched the health of his men as a loving
mother watches that of her children. Proof of this is
furnished in a Report of the Physician to the Fleet,
dated the 14th August 1805.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> In it Dr Leonard
Gillespie says that “the high state of health” was
“unexampled perhaps in any fleet or squadron heretofore
employed on a foreign station.” He attributes
this to such causes as the attention paid to the victualling
and purveying for the ships; a sane system of heating
and ventilation; lack of idleness and intemperance,
due to “the constant activity and motion in which the
fleet was preserved”; the promotion of cheerfulness
by means of music, dancing, and theatrical amusements;
comfortable accommodation of the sick; and
by the serving of Peruvian bark, mixed in wines or
spirits, to men “employed on the service of wooding
and watering,” which obviated any ill effects.</p>

<p>Nelson was quite able to “stand on his dignity,”
to use a colloquial and comprehensive phrase, and
several instances will be discovered by the reader as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
peruses the following pages, but it is quite wrong to
think that he was in the least a martinet. For instance,
during the trying period when he was hungering for the
French fleet to leave Toulon, he wrote to an officer:
“We must all in our several stations exert ourselves
to the utmost, and not be nonsensical in saying, ‘I have
an order for this, that, or the other,’ if the king’s
service clearly marks what ought to be done.” Everyone
has heard how Nelson referred to his captains and
himself as “a band of brothers.” You have only to
turn to the memoirs of these gallant officers to learn
the truthfulness of this remark. They loved him: that
is the only term that exactly meets the case.</p>

<p>What of the humbler men who worked the ships?
Read the following, which was sent home by a rough
but large-hearted sailor of the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, Collingwood’s
flagship at Trafalgar, when he heard that the
Master Mariner lay cold in the gloomy cockpit of the
<i>Victory</i>: “Our dear Admiral is killed, so we have paid
pretty sharply for licking ’em. I never set eyes on
him, for which I am both sorry and glad; for to be
sure I should like to have seen him&mdash;but then, all the
men in our ship who have seen him are such soft
toads, they have done nothing but blast their eyes and
cry ever since he was killed. God bless you! Chaps
that fought like the Devil sit down and cry like a wench.”</p>

<p>This spontaneous and perhaps unconscious tribute
is worth more than the encomiums of all modern historians
and biographers put together.</p>

<p>In studying the life of one who has played a leading
rôle on the stage of history there are always a number
of subsidiary authorities which will repay perusal.
The memoirs of the men who were associated with him,
of those of his contemporaries who occupied official
or high social positions, even of much humbler folk
who have transferred their opinions to paper or had it
done for them, are oftentimes extremely important.
To print a bibliography of the works of this kind which
I have consulted would be inadvisable in such a volume<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
as this, necessarily limited as it is to a certain number
of pages. I need only say that the nooks and crannies
have been explored besides the main thoroughfare.</p>

<p>In the Foreword to my companion volume upon
Napoleon, I endeavoured to show that periods of
history are merely make-believe divisions for purposes
of clearness and reference. I wish to still further
emphasise this extremely important point, because I
find that one of our most cherished delusions is that
history is largely a matter of dates. Nothing of the
kind! Those who think thus are confusing history
with chronology&mdash;in other words, mistaking one of
the eyes for the whole body. Dates are merely useful
devices similar to the numerals on the dial of a clock,
which enable us to know the hour of the day without
abstruse calculations. The figures 1805 help us to
memorise a certain concrete event, such as the battle
of Trafalgar, but they do not tell us anything of the
origin of that event any more than a clock defines the
meaning of time.</p>

<p>The age in which Nelson lived was not conspicuous
for its morals. This is a factor which must be taken
into consideration when we attempt to sum up his
character. The standards of 1911 are scarcely the
standards of over a century ago. The code of virtue
varies, although the law does not. The grave of
Nelson’s moral reputation was dug in Sicily, where he
had every provocation, but he certainly never attempted
to extricate himself from the pit into which he had
fallen. “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>” is a good maxim
for the Gospel of Things as they Ought to Be, but cannot
apply to the Testament of Things as they Were. The
vanity of both Nelson and Lady Hamilton contributed
to their downfall, the sordid story of which is necessarily
referred to in later pages of this work. I am of opinion
that the lack of sympathy shown to the Admiral,
particularly during Pitt’s administrations, was largely
due to Court influence. George III. was a man of
frigid austerity, and Nelson’s private life was too well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
known for the King to countenance it by showing him
favours. He recognised the value of the man’s services,
but preferred to take as little notice as possible of the
man himself. In this he was unjust.</p>

<p>Although Nelson hated the French so vehemently,
I cannot help thinking, after a prolonged study of his
career, that he had many of their characteristics. His
vivacity, his imagination, his moods tend to confirm
me in this. A less typical specimen of John Bull would
be difficult to find.</p>

<p>A word or two concerning Nelson’s crowning victory
and then I must bring my lengthy introduction to a
conclusion. It has a literature all its own. A wordy
warfare, which was indulged in the correspondence
columns of the <cite>Times</cite> from July to October 1905,
made one almost believe that it is easier to fight a battle
than to describe it accurately. To use Prof. Sir J.
Knox Laughton’s terse phrase, “the difficulty is that
the traditional account of the battle differs, in an important
detail, from the prearranged plan.” The late
Admiral Colomb held a brief for the theory that the
two columns of the British fleet moved in line abreast,
or in line of bearing, as against the old supposition of
two columns, line ahead. In this contention, he is
supported by Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge, G.C.B.,
whose ideas are set forth in a pamphlet issued by the
Navy Records Society, an institution which is doing
excellent work in rescuing historical documents relating
to the service from ill-deserved oblivion. To add further
to the discussion would probably serve no useful purpose.
The second volume of “Logs of the Great Sea-fights
(1794&ndash;1805),” and “Fighting Instructions, 1530&ndash;1816,”
both published by the Society already mentioned, will
be found extremely useful to those who would pursue
the subject in detail.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Thus</span><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> runs one of the verses of a song dear
to the British sailor for many a long year.
Nelson, dead over a century, is still revered
in the King’s Navy. To the landsman there is no
more popular hero. The <i>Victory</i>, riding at anchor in
the placid waters of the Solent and in view of the cobble-covered
sally port through which the Hero walked to
his barge, still flies an admiral’s flag. One of the most
modern battleships in the service bears his name, the
most famous of London’s many columns is crowned
by his effigy. Canvas sails have given place to steam
turbines, the days of oak and hemp are gone, but the
memory of “the greatest sea captain of all time” is
at once an incentive and an inspiration to every true
patriot. His ashes lie in the crypt of St Paul’s Cathedral;
his spirit lives in the nation for whom he sacrificed his
life. Perhaps we should not be far wrong in venturing
the apparent paradox that the further we recede from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
his life and times the more clearly we understand his
consummate genius and appreciate the value of his
achievements. There is no sunset, only an added
glory with the passing of the years.</p>

<p>Horatio Nelson was born in the quaint old parsonage
house of Burnham Thorpe, a Norfolk Sleepy Hollow,
on the 29th September 1758. His father, the Rev.
Edmund Nelson, M.A., was rector of the parish, and
as a clergyman was following the profession of his
immediate ancestor. His mother, Catherine Nelson,
was the daughter of the Rev. Dr Maurice Suckling,
Rector of Wooton, Norfolk, Prebendary of Westminster,
and grandnephew of Sir John Suckling, whose name is
known to all students of English literature and of
history. Galfridus Walpole, another of Mrs Nelson’s
relatives, had displayed considerable bravery in an
engagement with the French in Vado Bay in 1711.
It was through Captain Maurice Suckling, Nelson’s
uncle, that the young son of the parsonage eventually
entered the Navy. In addition, his mother was a
grandniece of Sir Robert Walpole, the famous Whig
statesman, and could therefore boast a distinguished
lineage.</p>

<p>Horatio was the sixth child of a constantly growing
family, and early caused anxiety owing to his delicate
constitution. In later years his letters and despatches
teem with reference to his ill-health, which was accentuated,
of course, by injuries which he received in the
performance of his duty. However, he breathed
deeply of the North Sea air which wafted through his
native village, was tenderly cared for by loving parents,
and became sufficiently robust to be sent to the High
School at Norwich. The venerable building, endowed
by Edward VI., stands within the cathedral precincts.
It is now fronted by a statue of its illustrious scholar.
Later he attended a school at North Walsham, now
one of the yachting centres of the Norfolk Broads,
where the curious will find a brick on which the letters
H.&nbsp;N. are scratched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
It is somewhat remarkable that so few boys who
become great men ever attract sufficient notice during
their early scholastic career for their comrades to remember
anecdotes about them likely to be of assistance
to the biographer. Few anecdotes of Nelson in his
younger days have been handed down to posterity,
but the following have probably some basis of fact.</p>

<p>When quite a small boy he stayed for a time with his
grandmother. On one occasion he did not return at
the accustomed dinner-hour, thereby causing the good
dame considerable anxiety, especially as gipsies were
in the neighbourhood and kidnapping was by no
means unknown. He was eventually found seated
on the banks of a brook examining with considerable
interest a number of birds’ eggs he had secured in
company with a chum. “I wonder, child, that fear
did not drive you home!” the old lady said when
the missing Horatio was restored to her. “Fear,
grandmamma!” he replied in a tone of disgust, “I
never saw fear&mdash;what is it?”</p>

<p>There you have the secret of Nelson’s life summed up
in a single pregnant sentence. His total lack of fear
carried him through many a trying ordeal, enabled
him at times to defy the command of a senior officer
when he was convinced that his own plan of operations
was better, and helped him to bear the heat and
burden of the day when his physical energy was almost
exhausted.</p>

<p>On another occasion he was “dared” by some
companions to visit the graveyard unattended at
night. As a token of good faith he was to bring a
twig from a certain yew tree at the south-west corner
of All Saints’ Church. The uncanny task was successfully
accomplished. From thenceforth he was a hero,
as he deserved to be.</p>

<p>A further instance of Nelson’s early lack of fear is
afforded us. His master at North Walsham was particularly
proud of a certain pear-tree, and his scholars
were equally covetous of the delicious fruit which it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
bore. Each preferred the other in the task of picking
any of the pears because of the speedy retribution
which they knew would follow. One night Horatio
volunteered the task. His friends tied several sheets
together and lowered him from the dormitory to the
garden. He swarmed up the tree, secured the forbidden
and therefore much prized fruit, and was hauled up
again. On distributing the booty, he justified his
action in his own mind by assuring the recipients that
he had only taken the pears “because every other boy
was afraid.” Few hours passed before the schoolmaster
found that his tree had been plundered. It
redounds to the credit of the boys that they refused
to “split” on their comrade, although it is said that a
tempting reward was offered for the discovery of the
culprit.</p>

<p>One winter morning Horatio and his brother William
set out for school on their ponies. They had not gone
very far before they found the snow so deep as to be
almost impassable. They returned to the Parsonage
and told their father of the great drifts. He persuaded
them to try again, adding that he left it to their
honour not to turn back unless it was absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>The snow was falling in heavy flakes when they
made their second attempt. William’s heart soon
failed him. He suggested that they had sufficient
reason to return. Horatio was as adamant. “Father
left it to our honour. We must go forward,” he
replied, and in due course they arrived at the
school.</p>

<p>William, who was the elder by seventeen months,
had the greatest affection and esteem for his brother.
In later years he was his constant correspondent, and
after Horatio’s death he was created Earl Nelson of
Trafalgar. Like his father and grandfather, William
became a clergyman, in which profession he rose
to the dignity of Prebendary and Vice Dean of
Canterbury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
It was during the Christmas vacation of 1770 that
Nelson casually picked up a newspaper and read of
Captain Maurice Suckling’s appointment to the <i>Raisonnable</i>,
a ship of sixty-four guns. The announcement
seems to have had an instant effect upon Horatio.
“Oh, William,” he exclaimed to his brother, who was
standing near, “do, <em>do</em> write to father, and tell him that
I want to go to sea with uncle!”</p>

<p>The Rev. Edmund Nelson was staying at Bath owing
to ill-health. When he received his son’s letter he
was inclined to dismiss the proposition as a mere boyish
whim. On thinking it over a little more carefully he
decided that perhaps the youngster really desired
what he asked, and he accordingly consulted his
brother-in-law on the matter. The officer replied in
the easy-going manner of sailors, “Well, let him come
and have his head knocked off by the first cannon-ball&mdash;that
will provide for him.” He was afraid
Horatio would never be able to stand the rough-and-ready
life, but he had the good sense to know that
there is nothing like putting a theory to a practical
test.</p>

<p>The Navy was not then the skilfully-organised
machine it has since become. It was one of the privileges
of a captain that he might take two or three lads
to sea with him as midshipmen or to serve in some
subordinate position. Captain Suckling accordingly
sent for Horatio, and we find his name on the ship’s
books under date of the 1st January 1771. The <i>Raisonnable</i>
was then anchored in the Medway.</p>

<p>The lad’s father accompanied his twelve-year-old
son as far as London, put him into the Chatham stagecoach,
and then left him to his own resources. It was
neither a pleasant journey in the rambling old carriage,
nor were the streets of Chatham particularly inviting
when he set foot in them. Nobody met the adventurer,
and for some time he wandered about until he
met an officer who directed him to the ship which
was to be his temporary home. When he was safely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
on board it was to find that his uncle had not
arrived.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The <i>Raisonnable</i> was one of the vessels commissioned
when hostilities between Great Britain and Spain
appeared imminent owing to trouble respecting the
Falkland Islands, a group in the South Atlantic. In
1770 Spain had insulted the British colonists there by
compelling the garrison at Fort Egmont to lower their
flag. The matter was settled amicably, for the all-sufficient
reason that Spain did not feel strong enough
to come to blows with Great Britain unless she was
assisted by France, and as the support of that Power
was not forthcoming, she climbed down. Consequently
Nelson was not introduced to the horrors of
naval warfare at this early stage, and the cannon-ball
which his uncle prophesied would knock off the lad’s
head did not leave the cannon’s mouth.</p>

<p>When the <i>Raisonnable</i> was paid off Captain Suckling
was given command of the guard-ship <i>Triumph</i> (74),
stationed in the Medway, and recognising that no good
could come to his nephew by staying on such a vessel,
he secured a position for him shortly afterwards in a
merchant ship bound for the West Indies. This was
not a difficult matter, because the Master was John
Rathbone, who had served with Suckling on the <i>Dreadnought</i>
during part of the Seven Years’ War, that great
struggle in which Louis XV. of France had been forced
to cede Canada to Great Britain.</p>

<p>Nelson seems to have enjoyed the experience. In a
sketch of his life, which he wrote several years later
for the <cite>Naval Chronicle</cite>, he says:</p>

<p>“From this voyage I returned to the <i>Triumph</i> at
Chatham in July 1772; and, if I did not improve in
my education, I returned a practical seaman, with a
horror of the Royal Navy, and with a saying, then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
constant with the seamen, ‘Aft the most honour,
forward the better man!’ It was many weeks before
I got in the least reconciled to a man-of-war, so deep
was the prejudice rooted; and what pains were taken to
instil this erroneous principle in a young mind! However,
as my ambition was to be a seaman, it was always
held out as a reward, that if I attended well to my
navigation, I should go in the cutter and decked longboat,
which was attached to the commanding officer’s
ship at Chatham. Thus by degrees I became a good
pilot, for vessels of that description, from Chatham
to the Tower of London, down the Swin, and to the
North Foreland; and confident of myself amongst
rocks and sands, which has many times since been of
the very greatest comfort to me. In this way I was
trained, till the expedition towards the North Pole
was fitted out; when, although no boys were allowed
to go in the ships (as of no use), yet nothing could
prevent my using every interest to go with Captain
Lutwidge in the <i>Carcass</i>; and, as I fancied I was to
fill a man’s place, I begged I might be his coxswain:
which, finding my ardent desire for going with him,
Captain Lutwidge complied with, and has continued
the strictest friendship to this moment. Lord Mulgrave,
who I then first knew, continued his kindest friendship
and regard to the last moment of his life. When the
boats were fitted out to quit the two ships blocked up
in the ice, I exerted myself to have the command of a
four-oared cutter raised upon, which was given me,
with twelve men; and I prided myself in fancying I
could navigate her better than any other boat in the
ship.”</p>

<p>In this cold, matter-of-fact way, Nelson dismisses
a phase of his life fraught with peril and adventure.
When the majority, if not all, of his former school-fellows
were reading of the doings of gallant seamen
and brave soldiers he was undergoing actual experiences.
The expedition in question had been suggested by
the Royal Society, and was commanded by Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Constantine John Phipps, eldest son of Lord Mulgrave.
The <i>Racehorse</i> and <i>Carcass</i>, heavy ships known as bombs
because they mounted one or more mortars for use in
bombardments when on ordinary service, sailed from
the Nore on the 4th June 1773. All went well until
the 31st July, when the ice closed upon the vessels,
and further progress became impossible.</p>

<p class="notbold">Stephen Reid</p></div></div>

<p>“The following day,” says Colonel J.&nbsp;M. Tucker in
his “Life and Naval Memoirs of Lord Nelson,” “there
was not the smallest opening, the ships were within
less than two lengths of each other. The ice, which the
day before had been flat, and almost level with the
water’s edge, was now in many places forced higher
than the mainyard by the pieces squeezing together.
A day of thick fog followed; it was succeeded by clear
weather; but the passage by which the ships had
entered from the westward was closed, and no open
water was in sight, either in that or any other quarter.
By the pilot’s advice, the men were set to cut a passage
and warp<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> through the small openings to the westward.
They sawed through pieces of ice twelve feet thick;
and this labour continued the whole day, during which
their utmost efforts did not move the ships above three
hundred yards, while they were driven together, with
the ice, far to the north-east and east by the current.
Sometimes a field of several acres square would be
lifted up between two larger islands, and incorporated
with them; and thus these larger pieces continued to
grow by cohesive aggregation. Another day passed,
and there seemed no probability of getting the ships
out, without a strong east or north-east wind.</p>

<p>“The season was far advanced, and every hour
lessened the chance of extricating themselves. Young
as he was, Nelson was appointed to command one of
the boats which were sent out to explore a passage into
the open water. It was the means of saving a boat
belonging to the <i>Racehorse</i> from a singular but imminent
danger. Some of the officers had fired at, and wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
a walrus.... The wounded animal dived immediately,
and brought up a number of its companions; and they
all joined in an attack upon the boat. They wrested
an oar from one of the men; and it was with the utmost
difficulty that the crew could prevent them from staving
or upsetting her, till the <i>Carcass’s</i> boat, under Nelson,
came up. The walrusses, finding their enemies thus
reinforced, dispersed.</p>

<p>“A short time after this occurrence, young Nelson
exposed himself in a more daring manner. One night,
during the mid-watch, he stole from the ship with one
of his comrades, taking advantage of a rising fog, and
set out over the ice in pursuit of a bear. Nelson, in
high spirits, led the way over the frightful chasms in
the ice, armed with a rusty musket, as was his companion.
It was not, however, long before the adventurers were
missed by those on board; and, as the fog had much
increased, the anxiety of Captain Lutwidge and his
officers for them was very great. Between three
and four in the morning, the mist having nearly dispersed,
the hunters were discovered at a considerable
distance, attacking a large bear. The signal for their
return was instantly made; but it was in vain that
Nelson’s companion urged him to obey it. He was at
this time divided by a rent in the ice from his shaggy
antagonist, which probably saved his life; for the
musket had flashed in the pan, and their ammunition
was expended. ‘Never mind,’ exclaimed Horatio,
‘do but let me get a blow at this devil with the butt
end of my musket, and we shall have him.’ His companion,
finding that entreaty was in vain, left him,
and regained the ship. The Captain, seeing the young
adventurer’s danger, ordered a gun to be fired to terrify
the enraged animal; this had the desired effect; but
Nelson was obliged to return without his bear. Captain
Lutwidge, though he could not but admire so daring
a disposition, reprimanded him rather sternly for such
rashness, and for conduct so unworthy of the situation
he occupied; and desired to know what motive he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
could have for hunting a bear. ‘Sir,’ he replied,
pouting his lip, as he was wont to do when agitated,
‘I wished to kill a bear, that I might carry its skin to
my father.’”</p>

<p>Towards the middle of August the two ships were
able to forge their way through the ice, although not
without considerable difficulty, and duly sailed for
home waters.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> are fortunate in having an account of
Nelson’s early career at sea penned by
himself, otherwise the material at our disposal
would be extremely scanty. The story of the
next few years is therefore told in his own words.
What it lacks in picturesqueness is made up for in
authenticity:</p>

<p>“On our arrival in England,” he says, “and paid
off, 15 October [1773], I found that a squadron was
fitting out for the East Indies; and nothing less than
such a distant voyage could in the least satisfy my
desire of maritime knowledge: and I was placed in
the <i>Seahorse</i> of 20 guns, with Captain Farmer, and
watched in the foretop; from whence in time I was
placed on the quarter-deck: having, in the time I was
in this ship, visited almost every part of the East Indies,
from Bengal to Bussorah. Ill-health induced Sir
Edward Hughes, who had always shown me the greatest
kindness, to send me to England in the <i>Dolphin</i> of
20 guns, with Captain James Pigot, whose kindness
at that time saved my life. This ship was paid off at
Woolwich on 24 September, 1776. On the 26th I
received an order from Sir James Douglas, who commanded
at Portsmouth, to act as lieutenant of the
<i>Worcester</i>, 64, Captain Mark Robinson, who was ordered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
to Gibraltar with a convoy.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> In this ship I was at sea
with convoys till 2 April, 1777, and in very bad weather.
But although my age might have been a sufficient
cause for not entrusting me with the charge of a watch,
yet Captain Robinson used to say, ‘he felt as easy
when I was upon deck, as any officer in the ship.’</p>

<p>“On [the 9th] April, 1777, I passed my examination
as a lieutenant; and received my commission the next
day, as second lieutenant of the <i>Lowestoffe</i> frigate of
32 guns, Captain (now Lieutenant-Governor of Greenwich
Hospital) William Locker. In this ship I went
to Jamaica; but even a frigate was not sufficiently
active for my mind, and I got into a schooner, tender
to the <i>Lowestoffe</i>. In this vessel I made myself a
complete pilot for all the passages through the (Keys)
Islands situated on the north side [of] Hispaniola.
Whilst in this frigate, an event happened which presaged
my character; and, as it conveys no dishonour to the
officer alluded to, I shall relate it.</p>

<p>“Blowing a gale of wind, and very heavy sea, the
frigate captured an American letter of marque.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> The
first lieutenant was ordered to board her, which he did
not, owing to the very high sea. On his return on
board, the captain said, ‘Have I no officer in the ship
who can board the prize?’ On which the master ran
to the gangway, to get into the boat; when I stopped
him, saying, ‘It is my turn now; and if I come back,
it is yours.’ This little incident has often occurred
to my mind; and I know it is my disposition, that
difficulties and dangers do but increase my desire of
attempting them.</p>

<p>“Sir Peter Parker, soon after his arrival at Jamaica,
1778, took me into his own flag-ship, the <i>Bristol</i>, as
third lieutenant; from which I rose by succession to
be first. Nothing particular happened whilst I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
in this ship, which was actively employed off Cape
François, being the commencement of the French war.”</p>

<p>A few words with reference to the hostilities mentioned
are needed as explanation. The war between Great
Britain and her colonists in North America, which
culminated in the birth of a new World-Power, now
known as the United States, had broken out in 1775,
although the seeds of dissension had been sown much
earlier. This unfortunate and disastrous quarrel had
also embroiled “the mother of nations” in a strife
with France and Spain, whose help the New Englanders
secured in 1778 and 1779 respectively. In 1780
Holland became involved. The foolishness of not having
sufficiently watched the doings of a potential enemy
now became apparent. For several years “resolute
Choiseul, the abrupt proud man” of Carlyle, had
bent his energies on increasing the French navy, and
when the Brest fleet of thirty-two sail-of-the-line, under
Count D’Orvilliers, met the British fleet of thirty sail,
under Vice-Admiral the Hon. A. Keppel, off Ushant
on the 27th July 1778, the action was indecisive. In
American waters Lord Howe hove in sight of the fleet
under D’Estaing, the French commander having better
ships and heavier metal, but while Howe was manœuvring
to attack the enemy a storm parted the would-be
contestants. Both suffered considerable damage by
wind and not by shot as had been anticipated. Shortly
afterwards Admiral Byron took over Howe’s command
and endeavoured to come up with D’Estaing’s ships.
Unfortunately the Frenchman had sailed to the West
Indies, which “in this protracted contest,” to use the
words of Admiral Mahan, was to be “the chief scene
of naval hostilities....” “The West Indies is the
Station for honour,” said Nelson sometime later.
Froude, the historian, predicted that “If ever the naval
exploits of this country are done into an epic poem&mdash;and
since the <i>Iliad</i> there has been no subject better
fitted for such treatment or better deserving it&mdash;the
West Indies will be the scene of the most brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
cantos.” We shall have occasion to refer to this great
strategic point many times in these pages, especially
in the great game of hide-and-seek between Napoleon’s
captains and Nelson immediately preceding the Trafalgar
campaign.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> The year 1778 was not a brilliant one in
British naval annals, although it closed by Hotham
and Barrington attacking D’Estaing off St Lucia and
preventing him from landing more than half the troops
intended for the subjugation of that island. As a
consequence the force under Chevalier de Michaud
surrendered, and St Lucia was won.</p>

<p>“On 8 December, 1778,” Nelson continues, “I was
appointed commander of the <i>Badger</i> brig; and was
first sent to protect the Mosquito shore, and the Bay
of Honduras, from the depredations of the American
privateers. Whilst on this service, I gained so much
the affections of the settlers, that they unanimously
voted me their thanks, and expressed their regret on
my leaving them; entrusting to me to describe to Sir
Peter Parker and Sir John Dalling their situation,
should a war with Spain break out. Whilst I commanded
this brig, H.M.S. <i>Glasgow</i>, Captain Thomas
Lloyd, came into Montego Bay, Jamaica, where the
<i>Badger</i> was laying: in two hours afterwards she took
fire by a cask of rum; and Captain Lloyd will tell
you, that it was owing to my exertions, joined to his,
that her whole crew were rescued from the flames.”</p>

<p>This stirring incident merits a more detailed description
than the bare facts which Nelson chose to set
forth. The crew was in a panic when he and his
men set foot on the deck of the doomed vessel, and
by almost superhuman exertions managed to throw
all the gunpowder in the magazine overboard before
the flames reached it. He also ordered that the loaded
cannon should be directed upward, so that when they
exploded, owing to the intense heat, no damage would
result. Thus early in his career did Nelson show that
he was not at a loss when the unusual and unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
happened. In a letter to Captain Locker, who was ill,
the young officer describes the fate of the <i>Glasgow</i> as
“a most shocking sight; and had it happened half
an hour later, in all probability a great many people
would have been lost.” He also notes that the company
of the derelict were falling ill very fast owing to the
constant tropical rains to which the men were exposed,
there being no room for them on the <i>Badger</i>.</p>

<p>“On 11 June, 1779,” Nelson continues, “I was
made post into the <i>Hinchinbrook</i>. When, being at
sea, and Count d’Estaing arriving at Hispaniola (Haïti)
with a very large fleet and army from Martinique, an
attack on Jamaica was expected. In this critical
state, I was by both admiral and general entrusted
with the command of the batteries at Port Royal;
and I need not say, as the defence of this place was the
key to the port of the whole naval force, the town of
Kingston, and Spanish Town, it was the most important
post in the whole island.”</p>

<p>D’Estaing’s fleet consisted of twenty-two sail-of-the-line,
excluding transports and privateers which
had attached themselves to him, and it was commonly
reported that he had no fewer than 20,000 troops on
board. Nelson, as noted above, was now Post-Captain,
and although he had no occasion to prove his ability
as a commander of land batteries, he seems to have
taken kindly to the situation. In a letter to his friend
Captain Parker, dated the 12th August 1779, he states
that “Jamaica is turned upside down since you left
it,” and furnishes particulars of the measures made for
the defence of the island. “You must not be surprised
to hear of my learning to speak French,” he
remarks as a humorous aside.</p>

<p>To help to achieve the downfall of the wily d’Estaing
was not to fall to Nelson’s lot. That worthy hastened
to Savannah, which was attacked by troops under
General Lincoln and himself. They were routed by the
British lines, whereupon d’Estaing sailed away.</p>

<p>Great Britain was now at war with Spain, which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
thrown in her lot with France, and was soon to feel the
effects of the Armed Neutrality, consisting of Russia,
Sweden, Denmark, Holland, and Prussia. They resented
England’s right to search neutral ships, with
the result that the latter Power could not retain her
supremacy at sea, a cause of Cornwallis’s surrender
at Yorktown and the consequent loss of the American
Colonies. In January 1780 it was resolved to make
an attempt to take the important post of Fort San
Juan, on the river of that name. This would materially
aid the British to secure the city of Granada, on Lake
Nicaragua, and to sever the communications of the
enemy between their northern and southern dominions.
The idea originated with Dalling, Governor of Jamaica,
to whom history has scarcely done justice. The naval
force was entrusted to Nelson, the command of the
troops to Captain John Polson.</p>

<p>The soldiers at the disposal of the intrepid adventurers
were a mere handful, scarcely 500 in all, but perhaps
that fact added the necessary spice of danger. Nelson
left his ship, and “carried troops in boats one hundred
miles up a river, which none but Spaniards since the
time of the buccaneers had ever ascended,” to use
his own words. He “boarded” an outpost of the
enemy, situated on an island in the river; “made
batteries, and afterwards fought them, and was a
principal cause of our success.” When the miniature
expedition arrived at Fort San Juan the rainy season
had commenced, bringing malaria in its train. Nelson
was all for making an immediate attack, but Polson
ruled the slower, and perhaps surer, method of erecting
batteries and so forth, in which Nelson lent a willing
hand. “I want words to express the obligations I owe
to Captain Nelson,” Polson told Governor Dalling.
“He was the first on every service, whether by day or
night. There was not a gun fired but was pointed by
him, or by Captain Despard, Chief Engineer.” Fever
played havoc with the men; of the 200 sailors of the
<i>Hinchinbrook</i>, no fewer than “eighty-seven took to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
their beds in one night; and of the two hundred, one
hundred and forty-five were buried in mine and Captain
Collingwood’s<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> time: and I believe very few, not more
than ten, survived of that ship’s crew; a proof how
necessary expedition is in those climates.” Nelson’s
own health was undermined by dysentery. A few
hours before the Spanish flag gave place to the Union
Jack he left the region of the fort in order to join the
<i>Janus</i> (44 guns), of which he had been given command.
The ship being stationed at Jamaica, he was taken to
Port Royal in a sloop. Here he met with a good and
tender-hearted friend in Lady Parker, the wife of Sir
Peter Parker, Commander-in-Chief at Jamaica, but he
gained so little in strength that he was compelled to ask
leave of absence and leave the West Indies for England.
Had he stayed it is improbable that he could have
rendered useful service while in such a low condition.
The expedition eventually ended in failure. He sailed
on the 4th September 1780 in the <i>Lion</i>, commanded
by Captain the Hon. William Cornwallis, a younger
son of Earl Cornwallis, who acted the part of nurse to
the patient’s entire satisfaction, and cemented a friendship
which lasted until Nelson’s death.</p>

<p>Having to resign the <i>Janus</i> probably caused Nelson
more torture than his physical suffering, for he was
intensely ambitious. It is stated that when he arrived
in England he would not proceed to Bath to drink the
waters until he had been conveyed to the Admiralty
to beg for another vessel. “This they readily promised
me,” he observed in a humorous way, “thinking it not
possible for me to live.” At Bath he stayed with
Mr Spry, an apothecary, who resided at 2 Pierrepont
Street; his medical adviser was Dr Woodward.</p>

<p>On the 23rd January 1781 Nelson was able to inform
Captain Locker that he was “now upon the mending
hand,” although he had been “obliged to be carried
to and from bed, with the most excruciating tortures.”
Some three weeks later further progress was reported;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
“My health, thank God, is very near perfectly restored;
and I have the perfect use of all my limbs, except my
left arm, which I can hardly tell what is the matter
with it. From the shoulder to my fingers’ ends are
as if half dead; but the surgeon and doctors give me
hopes it will all go off. I most sincerely wish to be
employed, and hope it will not be long.”</p>

<p>Again the flicker of ambition is evident, always a
good sign in a patient. “I never was so well in health
that I can remember,” he writes on the 5th March.
On Monday of the following week he began his return
journey to London. Unfortunately his progress was
intermittent. He had “good” days and “bad”
days. Two months later we find Nelson telling his
beloved brother William that he has entirely lost the
use of his left arm and nearly of his left leg and thigh.
However, the surgeon who was attending him gave
him hopes of recovery, “when I will certainly come
into Norfolk, and spend my time there till I am
employed.”</p>

<p>At this period Nelson did not have to eat out his
heart in chagrin and disappointment owing to neglect
as some of our modern naval officers have had to do.
In August 1781, when his health had improved, he was
given command of the <i>Albemarle</i>, a frigate of 28
guns, and on the 23rd of that month he hoisted
his pennant at Woolwich. The appearance of the
little vessel pleased him considerably, his officers and
men even more so, as his letters abundantly testify.
“My quarter-deck is filled, much to my satisfaction,
with very genteel young men and seamen”; “I have
an exceeding good ship’s company. Not a man or
officer in her I would wish to change”; “I am perfectly
satisfied with both officers and ship’s company. All
my marines are likewise old standers,” are some of his
remarks to correspondents. We must not imagine
that Nelson necessarily had a pattern-ship and a pattern-crew
because of the kind things he said of them. His
recent recovery from serious illness has doubtless to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
be taken into consideration. We all see the world
and its inhabitants through rose-coloured glasses after
an enforced absence from the ordinary duties and
modes of life. A natural sweetness of disposition may
also partly account for his optimism. In later years
Samuel Rogers, the Banker-poet, recorded in his
entertaining “Table Talk” that “Lord Nelson was a
remarkably kind-hearted man. I have seen him spin
a teetotum with his <em>one</em> hand, a whole evening, for
the amusement of some children.”</p>

<p>The young captain’s first voyage in the <i>Albemarle</i>
was not unattended by adventures. His reference
to his experiences in the Autobiography is slightly
tinged with a semi-humorous cynicism one can readily
forgive, although it contrasts oddly with the remarks
just quoted. “In August, 1781,” he writes, “I was
commissioned for the <i>Albemarle</i>; and, it would almost
be supposed, to try my constitution, was kept the
whole winter in the North Sea.” He cruised to Elsinore,
where he found a number of vessels waiting for convoy
to Portsmouth and Plymouth. “We have not had
any success;” he complains, “indeed, there is nothing
you can meet, but what is in force: the Dutch have
not a single merchantman at sea. One privateer was
in our fleet, but it was not possible to lay hold of him.
I chased him an hour, and came fast up with him,
but was obliged to return to the fleet. I find since,
it was the noted Fall, the pirate.... What fools
the Dutch must have been not to have taken us into
the Texel. Two hundred and sixty sail the convoy
consisted of.”</p>

<p>On another occasion the British ships in the Downs
mistook Nelson and his motley collection for a Dutch
fleet. Many of the sail-of-the-line prepared for action
and would have chased their friends had not Nelson
sent a cutter to inform the officers of their ludicrous
error. In the early days of 1782 the <i>Albemarle</i> was
ordered to Portsmouth to take in eight months’ provisions,
“and I have no doubt was meant to go to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
East Indies with Sir Richard Bickerton,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> which I should
have liked exceedingly, but alas, how short-sighted are
the best of us.” The young captain then goes on to
tell his brother William of the fate which overtook him.
During a fierce gale an East India store ship collided
with the <i>Albermarle</i>. “We have lost our foremast,
and bowsprit, mainyard, larboard cathead, and quarter
gallery, the ship’s [figure] head, and stove in two places
on the larboard side&mdash;all done in five minutes. What
a change! but yet we ought to be thankful we did not
founder. We have been employed since in getting
jury-masts, yards, and bowsprit, and stopping the
holes in our sides. What is to become of us now, I
know not. She must go into dock, and I fear must be
paid off, she has received so much damage.”</p>

<p>A letter to the same correspondent, dated the 8th
February 1782, reveals something of Nelson’s philosophy
of life. “We all rise by deaths,” he asserts. “I got
my rank by a shot killing a post-captain, and I most
sincerely hope I shall, when I go, go out of [the] world
the same way; then we go all in the line of our profession&mdash;a
parson praying, a captain fighting.” He
had his wish gratified, as we all know. There was
something more than a suspicion of the Stoic in Nelson,
for while it cannot be said that he was unaffected
by passion, he certainly displayed praiseworthy indifference
to creature comforts when at sea. That he
grumbled to the authorities proves nothing to the
contrary. It was usually with reference to half-unseaworthy
ships, which added to the trials and troubles
of his men and oftentimes precluded him from doing
himself justice where the enemy was concerned. His
letters prove conclusively that he had the utmost
faith in God, whom he regarded as a powerful Ally.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Nelson sailed with a convoy to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Newfoundland and Quebec. The experience was anything
but pleasant, and when he returned to the latter
place in the middle of September he was “knocked
up with scurvy,” the old-time sailor’s curse, owing
to a diet of salt beef for eight weeks. “In the end,”
he says, “our cruise has been an unsuccessful one;
we have taken, seen, and destroyed more enemies
than is seldom done in the same space of time, but not
one arrived in port. But, however, I do not repine
at our loss: we have in other things been very fortunate,
for on 14 August we fell in with, in Boston Bay,
four sail-of-the-line,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and the <i>Iris</i>, French man-of-war,
part of M. Vaudreuil’s squadron, who gave us a pretty
dance for between nine or ten hours; but we beat all
except the frigate, and though we brought to for her,
after we were out of sight of the line-of-battle ships, she
tacked and stood from us. Our escape I think wonderful:
they were, upon the clearing up of a fog, within
shot of us, and chased us the whole time about one
point from the wind....” Nelson managed to avoid
the enemy by “running them amongst the shoals of
St George’s Bank,” a manœuvre which caused the
larger ships to stop pursuit. When he prepared for
action the commander of the frigate, deeming discretion
the better part of valour, wisely decided to rejoin his
comrades.</p>

<p>After taking another convoy from Quebec to New
York, Nelson sailed under the command of Lord Hood
for the West Indies, “the grand theatre of actions.”
Here he captured a French vessel attached to Vaudreuil’s
fleet, thereby getting some compensation for the loss
of the frigate. Her cargo consisted of naval material,
and as some of the British ships were urgently in want
of topmasts the prize was more than usually valuable.</p>

<p>He also attempted to recapture Turk’s Island, which
had been taken by the French. The proceeding was
audacious in the extreme, as he had very few ships at
his disposal. An officer was sent on shore, under cover<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
of a flag of truce, to demand surrender. This proving
abortive, a little band of 167 seamen and marines, under
Captain Charles Dixon, was landed. The <i>Admiral
Barrington</i> then came up, and together with the <i>Drake</i>,
was about to bombard the town, when a concealed
battery opened upon them. A steady fire was maintained
for an hour before Captain Dixon, who had
hoped to reach the enemy’s works while the ships
were engaging some of the French defenders, decided
that the experiment was too dangerous. The enemy’s
guns were fought by seamen, the troops had several
field-pieces at their disposal, and two pieces of cannon
were mounted on a hill, consequently continued persistence
would have been foolhardy. “With such a force,”
says the instigator of this expedition, “and their strong
position, I did not think anything further could be
attempted.”</p>

<p>Nelson succeeded in making himself thoroughly
acquainted with Lord Hood, who in his turn introduced
him to Prince William, then a midshipman and afterwards
William IV., “our Sailor King.” There was
mutual admiration. “He will be, I am certain, an
ornament to our Service,” Nelson tells Locker. “He
is a seaman, which you could hardly suppose. Every
other qualification you may expect from him. But he
will be a disciplinarian, and a strong one: he says he
is determined every person shall serve his time before
they shall be provided for, as he is obliged to serve
his.” Such is Nelson’s comment. That of the future
monarch was not made at the time, but when Nelson
went on board the <i>Barfleur</i> the incident made such an
impression on the Prince that he was able to paint a
graphic word-picture of the event many years after.
Nelson “appeared to be the merest boy of a captain
I ever beheld.... He had on a full-laced uniform;
his lank, unpowdered hair was tied in a stiff Hessian
tail, of an extraordinary length; the old-fashioned
flaps of his waistcoat added to the general quaintness
of his figure, and produced an appearance which particularly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
attracted my notice; for I had never seen
anything like it before, nor could I imagine who he was,
nor what he came about. My doubts were, however,
removed when Lord Hood introduced me to him. There
was something irresistibly pleasing in his address and
conversation; and an enthusiasm when speaking on
professional subjects that showed he was no common
being.... Throughout the whole of the American
War the height of Nelson’s ambition was to command
a line-of-battle ship; as for prize-money, it never entered
his thoughts: he had always in view the character of
his maternal uncle.”</p>

<p>On the 25th June 1783 Nelson was again at Portsmouth.
After seeing to the well-being of his sailors
he travelled on the leisurely stage-coach to London,
where he was presented to the King by Lord Hood.
In the following September hostilities were concluded
between Great Britain, America, France, Spain, and
Holland by the signature of the Treaty of Versailles.
The officer, therefore, found no difficulty in obtaining
six months’ leave to visit France. There he realised
that perhaps there might be some truth in the old
adage to the effect that Jack has a sweetheart in every
port.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Nelson</span> took the greatest possible interest
in everything he saw in France: “Sterne’s
‘Sentimental Journey’ is the best description
I can give of our tour.” He travelled in a chaise without
springs, slept on a straw bed&mdash;“O what a transition
from happy England!”&mdash;but had less fault to find
with the scenery about Montreuil, which he describes
as “the finest corn country that my eyes ever beheld,
diversified with fine woods, sometimes for two miles
together through noble forests. The roads mostly
were planted with trees, which made as fine an avenue
as to any gentleman’s country seat.” At St Omer
he lodged with “a pleasant French family,” and incidentally
made the acquaintance of “two very agreeable
young ladies, daughters, who honour us with their
company pretty often.... Therefore I must learn
French if ’tis only for the pleasure of talking to them,
for they do not speak a word of English.” Soon all
thoughts of study and of the “very agreeable” maidens
were banished from his impressionable mind by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
introduction to a Miss Andrews, the daughter of an
English clergyman. The affair rapidly ripened into
something more than friendship.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><i>
<span class="i0">Her faults he knew not, Love is always blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But every charm resolved within his mind.</span></i>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Nelson’s letters go far to prove the truth of Pope’s
couplet. Miss Andrews was, according to him, “the
most accomplished woman my eyes ever beheld.”
Unfortunately marriage is necessarily based on that
mundane and concrete thing, money. When the ardent
young officer came to look into the financial aspect of
the matter he found that his income did not exceed
£130 a year. His lady-love’s dowry was “1,000<i>l.</i>
I understand.” He therefore appealed to his uncle,
William Suckling, to allow him £100 per annum until
he could earn that sum for himself. Failing this source
of supply, would his relative “exert” himself “to
get me a guard-ship, or some employment in a public
office where the attendance of the principal is not
necessary...? In the India Service I understand
(if it remains under the Directors) their marine force
is to be under the command of a captain in the Royal
Navy: that is a station I should like.” He prays
that his uncle and his family “may never know the
pangs which at this instant tear my heart.”</p>

<p>Cupid’s shaft neither proved deadly nor barbed.
On his return to England Nelson dismissed his love
affair, and was soon “running at the ring of pleasure”
in London. He visited Lord Howe, First Lord of the
Admiralty, “who asked me if I wished to be employed,
which I told him I did”; dined with Lord Hood, who
made him feel quite at home, and told him “that
the oftener I came the happier it would make him.”
In January 1784 he was at Bath, and wrote to his
brother that he thought of paying a second visit to the
Continent till autumn and then spending the winter
with him at Burnham Thorpe. “I return to many
charming women, <em>but no charming woman</em> will return<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
with me,” is the plaint. “I want to be a proficient
in the language, which is my only reason for returning.
I hate their country and their manners,” which hatred,
it may be said, increased with the passing of the years.
This pessimistic strain is doubtless due to Nelson’s
undesirable position as a half-pay officer, but in the
middle of March his somewhat mercurial temperament
underwent a change to “set fair” on his appointment
to the <i>Boreas</i>, a frigate of 28 guns, under orders for
the Leeward Islands. The passengers included Lady
Hughes, wife of Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Hughes,
Bart., the Commander-in-Chief, and her daughter,
whom he very ungallantly described as “lumber.”
His brother, the Rev. William Nelson, accompanied
him as chaplain of the <i>Boreas</i>, but returned on the last
day of September 1784 owing to ill-health.</p>

<p>Before leaving Spithead Nelson had an alarming
adventure. He was riding what he describes as a
“<em>blackguard</em> horse” in company with a lady, when
both animals bolted. In order to save his legs from
being crushed in a narrow road blocked by a waggon
the young gallant was obliged to throw himself, and
he had the ill-luck to fall upon hard stones, which
injured his back and one of his limbs. His fair companion
was only saved from death by the presence of
mind of a passer-by who pluckily seized the bridle
of the terrified animal to which she was frantically
clinging.</p>

<p class="notbold">Stephen Reid</p></div></div>

<p>The voyage to Antigua was devoid of incident. It
was monotonous, and Nelson hated nothing so much
as monotony. Lady Hughes bored him, although it
is only just to add that he does not appear to have let
her know it. The lady herself was certainly impressed
with the kindly way Nelson treated “the young gentlemen
who had the happiness of being on his Quarter-Deck,”
to quote a letter written by her in 1806. “It
may reasonably be supposed,” she goes on, “that
among the number of thirty, there must be timid as
well as bold: the timid he never rebuked, but always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
wished to show them he desired nothing of them that
he would not instantly do himself: and I have known
him say&mdash;‘Well, sir, I am going a race to the masthead,
and I beg I may meet you there.’ No denial
could be given to such a wish, and the poor fellow
instantly began his march. His Lordship never took
the least notice with what alacrity it was done, but
when he met in the top, instantly began talking in the
most cheerful manner, and saying how much a person
was to be pitied that could fancy there was any danger,
or even anything disagreeable, in the attempt.... In like
manner he every day went to the schoolroom and saw
them do their nautical business, and at twelve o’clock
he was first upon the deck with his quadrant. No one
there could be behindhand in his business when their
Captain set them so good an example. One other
circumstance I must mention which will close the
subject, which was the day we landed at Barbadoes.
We were to dine at the Governor’s. Our dear Captain
said, ‘You must permit me, Lady Hughes, to carry one
of my aides-de-camp with me,’ and when he presented
him to the Governor, he said, ‘Your Excellency must
excuse me for bringing one of my midshipmen, as I
make it a rule to introduce them to all the good company
I can, they have few to look up to besides myself
during the time they are at sea.’ This kindness and
attention made the young people adore him; and
even his wishes, could they have been known, would
have been instantly complied with.”</p>

<p>When Nelson made the acquaintance of Sir Richard
Hughes he disliked him as much as he did her ladyship.
Probably the officer’s methods rather than the man
aroused this feeling of antagonism. “The Admiral
and all about him are great ninnies,” he writes, and
he soon showed in no vague way that he refused to support
the Commander-in-chief’s happy-go-lucky policy.
Truth to tell, Nelson had no love of authority. He
preferred to be a kind of attached free-lance, although
he was a strict disciplinarian in all relations between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
his junior officers and himself. “I begin to be very
strict in my Ship,” is an expression he used while in
the <i>Boreas</i>. In particular he fell foul of Hughes in
the matter of putting the Navigation Act into force.
This law had been passed by the Rump Parliament in
1651, when the Dutch held the proud position of the
world’s maritime carriers. It was enacted that only
English ships, commanded by an Englishman and
manned by a crew three-fourths of whom were also
of the same nationality, should be allowed to carry
the products of Asia, Africa, and America to home
ports. In a similar manner, European manufactures
had to be brought in English vessels or those of the
countries which produced the goods. In the latter
case the duties were heavier. It was Protection pure
and simple.</p>

<p>The Government of Charles II. and the Scottish
Parliament passed similar Acts in later years, thereby
fostering the trading companies which helped to lay
the foundations of our colonial empire. Such measures
were a constant “thorn in the flesh” to foreign statesmen.
Several of the statutes were repealed in 1823,
but the Navigation Act was not entirely abandoned by
Great Britain until 1848, after an existence of nearly
two hundred years.</p>

<p>Owing to their separation from the Motherland, the
former British colonists of America were, technically,
“foreigners,” and should have been subject to restrictions
in their commercial intercourse with the West
Indies. “I, for one,” Nelson confides to Locker,
“am determined not to suffer the Yankees to come
where my Ship is; for I am sure, if once the Americans
are admitted to any kind of intercourse with these
Islands, the views of the Loyalists in settling Nova
Scotia are entirely done away. They will first become
the Carriers, and next have possession of our Islands,
are we ever again embroiled in a French war. The
residents of these Islands are Americans by connexion
and by interest, and are inimical to Great Britain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
They are as great rebels as ever were in America, had
they the power to show it.... I am determined to
suppress the admission of Foreigners all in my power.”</p>

<p>“The Americans,” Nelson tells us in his Autobiography,
“when colonists, possessed almost all the
trade from America to our West India Islands; and
on the return of peace, they forgot, on this occasion,
that they became foreigners, and of course had no right
to trade in the British Colonies.</p>

<p>“Our governors and custom-house officers pretended
that by the Navigation Act they had a right to trade;
and all the West Indians wished what was so much for
their interest. Having given governors, custom-house
officers, and Americans, notice of what I would do, I
seized many of their vessels, which brought all parties
upon me; and I was persecuted from one island to
another, so that I could not leave my ship.” In this
matter it may be said that Nelson found it necessary
to keep himself “a close prisoner” to avoid being
served with writs which had been issued against him
by the owners of certain vessels which he had taken,
and who assessed their damages at several thousands
of pounds. “But conscious rectitude,” he adds, “bore
me through it; and I was supported, when the business
came to be understood, from home; and I proved (and
an Act of Parliament has since established it) that a
captain of a man-of-war is in duty bound to support
all the maritime laws, by his Admiralty commission
alone, without becoming a custom-house officer.”</p>

<p>The ardent captain also fell foul of Hughes in another
matter. The commissioner of the dockyard at Antigua
was Captain Moutray, a half-pay officer whom Hughes,
going beyond his powers, made commodore. Nelson
refused to recognise him as such. The case was investigated
by the Admiralty at the instigation of both
parties, with the result that Nelson was reprimanded
for taking the law into his own hands. Professor Sir
J. Knox Laughton, while admitting that “In both
cases Nelson was right in his contention,” is forced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
to add that “The first duty of an officer is to obey
orders, to submit his doubts to the Commander-in-chief,
and in a becoming manner to remonstrate against any
order he conceives to be improper; but for an officer
to settle a moot-point himself, and to act in contravention
of an order given under presumably adequate
knowledge of the circumstances, is subversive of the
very first principles of discipline. And these were not,
it will be noticed, questions arising out of any sudden
and unforeseen emergency, in providing for which
Nelson was forced to depart from his instructions.
Such emergencies do arise in the course of service,
and the decision of the officer may be a fair test of his
personal worth; but neither at St Kitts nor at Antigua
was there anything calling for instant decision, or any
question which might not have waited, pending a
reference to the Commander-in-chief or to the Admiralty.
And this was the meaning of the Admiralty minute on
Nelson’s conduct at Antigua, a most gentle admonition
for what might have been punished as a grave offence.”</p>

<p>It must not be inferred that there was any personal
bitterness on Nelson’s part regarding the Moutray
affair. He conceived it to be a question of principle, of
doing right and shunning wrong: “The character of
an Officer is his greatest treasure: to lower that, is to
wound him irreparably.” He was certainly on excellent
terms with the Commissioner’s wife, for whom he
cherished the most friendly feelings. Indeed, in one
of his letters he calls her his “dear, sweet friend....
Her equal I never saw in any country, or in any situation.”
Let it be frankly admitted, however, that
Nelson sometimes wore his heart on his sleeve, and
readily betrayed a state of feeling approaching deep
affection for any member of the gentler sex who
showed by her ready sympathy that she possessed a
kindly disposition. In the communication in which the
above passage occurs he notes that several of his comrades
had similar amorous tendencies. One officer has
proposed and been refused, another is forestalled in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
proposing to the lady of his choice by a more venturesome
lover, a third is “attached to a lady at Nevis,” the
said lady being a relation of the future Mrs Nelson.
He concludes with a reference to a niece of Governor
Parry, who “goes to Nevis in the <i>Boreas</i>; they trust
any young lady with me, being an old-fashioned fellow.”</p>

<p>On the 12th May 1785 Nelson confides to his brother
William that he has made the acquaintance of “a
young Widow,” and towards the end of the following
month he tells the same correspondent, “between
ourselves,” that he is likely to become a “<em>Benedict</em>....
Do not tell.” The lady of his choice was Mrs Nisbet,
then twenty-seven years of age and the mother of a
boy. We are fortunate in having copies of many of
his letters to her, for there is a wealth of affection&mdash;scarcely
love&mdash;and much sage philosophy in them.
“My greatest wish is to be united to you;” he writes
on the 11th September 1785, “and the foundation of
all conjugal happiness, real love and esteem, is, I trust,
what you believe I possess in the strongest degree
towards you.... We know that riches do not always
insure happiness; and the world is convinced that
I am superior to pecuniary considerations in my public
and private life; as in both instances I might have been
rich.” “You are too good and indulgent;” he avers
on another occasion, “I both know and feel it: but
my whole life shall ever be devoted to make you completely
happy, whatever whims may sometimes take
me. We are none of us perfect, and myself probably
much less so than you deserve.” “Fortune, that is,
money, is the only thing I regret the want of, and that
only for the sake of my affectionate Fanny. But the
Almighty, who brings us together, will, I doubt not,
take ample care of us, and prosper all our undertakings.
No dangers shall deter me from pursuing every honourable
means of providing handsomely for you and
yours....”</p>

<p>The messages lack the passionate fire of Napoleon’s
notes to Josephine, and on occasion are apt to be rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
too business-like for love letters. The romance did not
end like the fairy stories, they did not live “happily
ever after,” but there is no reason to doubt that Nelson
cherished a fond affection for the young widow. “Her
sense,” he informs his brother, “polite manners, and
to you I may say, beauty, you will much admire: and
although at present we may not be a rich couple, yet
I have not the least doubt but we shall be a happy
pair:&mdash;the fault must be mine if we are not.” Subsequent
events proved the truth of the latter remark.</p>

<p>In due course Sir Richard Hughes was succeeded in
the command of the Leeward Islands by Sir Richard
Bickerton. Nelson complains towards the end of
1786 that “A total stop is put to our carrying on
the Navigation Laws,” thereby showing that the old
problem had by no means been solved so far as he was
concerned.</p>

<p>On the 12th March 1787 Nelson and Mrs Nisbet were
married at Nevis. Prince William Henry, then captain
of the <i>Pegasus</i> and under Nelson’s command, gave
away the bride. Three months later the newly-wedded
captain was at Spithead, the almost unseaworthy
condition of the <i>Boreas</i> making it impossible for her to
stand another hurricane season in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Nelson was placed on half-pay, a state which he
by no means liked. In May 1788 he had reason to
believe that he would be employed again. “I have
invariably laid down,” he tells a friend, “and followed
close, a plan of what ought to be uppermost in the
breast of an Officer: that it is much better to serve
an ungrateful Country, than to give up his own fame.
Posterity will do him justice: a uniform conduct of
honour and integrity seldom fails of bringing a man
to the goal of Fame at last.”</p>

<p>Nelson visited Plymouth, Bath, and London, and
finally settled down at Burnham Thorpe. His letters
reveal the keenness with which he desired to obtain
employment. He applied to both Viscount Howe,
First Lord of the Admiralty, and to Lord Hood, but all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
his overtures came to nought. In September 1789 he
tells his old friend Locker that “I am now commencing
Farmer, not a very large one, you will conceive, but
enough for amusement. Shoot I cannot, therefore I
have not taken out a license; but notwithstanding the
neglect I have met with, I am happy, and now I see
the propriety of not having built my hopes on such
sandy foundations as the friendships of the Great.”</p>

<p>Not until January 1793 were his dearest wishes granted.
“After clouds comes sunshine,” he writes to his wife
from London. “The Admiralty so smile upon me,
that really I am as much surprised as when they frowned.
Lord Chatham yesterday made many apologies for not
having given me a Ship before this time, and said, that
if I chose to take a Sixty-four to begin with, I should
be appointed to one as soon as she was ready; and
whenever it was in his power, I should be removed into
a Seventy-four. Everything indicates War....”</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">So</span> far back as 1753 Lord Chesterfield prophesied
a revolution in France. “All the symptoms,”
he said, “which I have ever met with in history,
previous to great changes and revolutions in government,
now exist and daily increase in France.” Warning
rumbles heralded the storm, disregarded and thought
of no account by some, full of grave portent to others.
It burst in 1789.</p>

<p>At first William Pitt, First Lord of the Treasury and
Chancellor of the Exchequer, steadily refused to believe
that England was menaced by the Power which Fox
had termed “the natural enemy of Great Britain.”
In January 1792 he assured Parliament that “unquestionably
there never was a time in the history of this
country when, from the situation of Europe, we might
more reasonably expect fifteen years of peace than we
may at the present moment.” Either he was over
anxious to persuade himself that things were as he
would like them to be, or he was sadly mistaken. Pitt
had by no means the pugnacious disposition of his
father, the famous first Earl of Chatham. He thought
that the fire would burn itself out, that it would be
of short duration, whereas it steadily gained strength
and eventually involved practically every country in
Europe. Not until he was convinced that war was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
inevitable did the youngest Premier who ever handled
the reins of a British government accept the French
Revolution as of more than local consequence. Hitherto
domestic and financial questions had occupied his
attention and absorbed his energies. If France ignored
the nation which he represented, if she refrained from
poaching on British preserves or those of her allies,
he was quite content to return the compliment. Then
came the decree that the navigation of the river Scheldt
should be thrown open. It had previously been
guaranteed to the Dutch by Great Britain as well as
by other Powers, including France. The execution
of Louis XVI. followed, which led to Chauvelin, the
French Ambassador, being given his passports. If
Pitt had been slumbering he had wooed somnolence
with one eye open since the annexation of Savoy. He
was now fully awake, calm and self-reliant, for he
recognised the inevitable. It came in a declaration
of war by the French Convention against Holland and
Great Britain on the 1st February 1793. Macaulay,
writing from an essentially Whig point of view, states
that Pitt’s military administration “was that of a
driveller,” but to the impartial historian nothing is
further from the truth. He abandoned his schemes
of social reform to plunge whole-heartedly into the
titanic struggle which was to cost him his life. That
he made mistakes is obvious&mdash;what statesman has
not?&mdash;but he fell in his country’s cause as nobly as
Nelson at Trafalgar and Moore at Coruña.</p>

<p>When Nelson joined the <i>Agamemnon</i> he was immensely
pleased with her. He describes the vessel
as “without exception, the finest 64 in the service,
and has the character of sailing most remarkably well.”
She was a unit of the fleet under Lord Hood, her
destination the Mediterranean. The captain was
accompanied by his step-son, Josiah, whose first experience
of life at sea cannot have been pleasant. Off
the Nore the <i>Agamemnon</i> encountered a gale, with the
result that Josiah was “a little sea-sick.” However,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
“he is a real good boy, and most affectionately loves
me,” as his mother was informed. Off Cadiz Nelson
is able to report, “My Ship is remarkably healthy;
myself and Josiah never better.”</p>

<p>While part of the fleet was watering at Cadiz, Nelson
dined on board the <i>Concepcion</i> (112), a huge Spanish
sail-of-the-line. The experience afforded him food for
thought as well as for physical sustenance. He relates
the incident to his wife, criticises the four Spanish first-rates
in commission at the port as “very fine Ships,
but shockingly manned,” and adds that if the crews of
the six barges attached to the British vessels had boarded
one of these great vessels they could have taken her:
“The Dons may make fine Ships,&mdash;they cannot, however,
make men.” This summing-up of the <em>morale</em> of
the Spanish Navy is particularly valuable. A dozen
years later, when Napoleon was planning his wonderful
combinations to elude the prowess of Nelson, the lack
of skill displayed by the Spaniards was a constant
source of annoyance both to the Emperor and his naval
officers. Their bravery in action during the Trafalgar
Campaign is not questioned; their happy-go-lucky
code of discipline is on record in documentary evidence.
A bull fight which Nelson saw sickened and disgusted
him. “We had what is called a fine feast, for five
horses were killed, and two men very much hurt: had
they been killed, it would have been quite complete.”</p>

<p>The royalists at Toulon had not only openly rebelled
against the National Convention, but had requested
the assistance of the British fleet, then blockading the
harbour of the great southern arsenal, under Hood, who
was shortly afterwards joined by Langara in command
of a number of Spanish vessels. Nelson’s <i>Agamemnon</i>
was a fast sailer. He was therefore sent to Naples with
despatches to the courts of Turin and Naples requesting
10,000 troops for the assault of Toulon. The ardent
young officer, proud of the service which had been
delegated to him, was a little too sanguine as to Hood’s
triumph, yet his cheery optimism is tinged with cynicism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
when he writes to his wife: “I believe the world is
convinced that no conquests of importance can be made
without us; and yet, as soon as we have accomplished
the service we are ordered on, we are neglected. If
Parliament does not grant something to this Fleet,
our Jacks will grumble; for here there is no prize-money
to soften their hardships: all we get is honour
and salt beef. My poor fellows have not had a morsel
of fresh meat or vegetables for near nineteen weeks;
and in that time I have only had my foot twice on
shore at Cadiz. We are absolutely getting sick from
fatigue. No Fleet, I am certain, ever served their
Country with greater zeal than this has done, from the
Admiral to the lowest sailor.”</p>

<p>At Naples Nelson was received by the King “in the
handsomest manner,” and a promise of troops was
exacted without delay. He also made the acquaintance
of Lady Hamilton, wife of the British Minister, but
the romantic attachment between them did not begin
until several years later. His Majesty was on the
point of visiting the <i>Agamemnon</i> when the Captain
received intelligence from the Prime Minister&mdash;Sir John
Acton, an English baronet&mdash;that a French sail-of-the-line
convoying three vessels had anchored under
Sardinia. Nelson acknowledges to his brother, on the
27th September 1793, that “Fortune has not crowned
my endeavours with success. The French have either
got into Leghorn, or are housed in some port of Corsica....
I purpose staying three days in Port, when I shall get
to Toulon, for I cannot bear the thought of being absent
from the scene of action.” His unsuccessful search
for the enemy had precluded him from accompanying
such Neapolitan troops as were ready to be sent to
the scene of conflict. In addition a large French
frigate had put into the neutral port of Leghorn, which
gave him further anxiety. As her commander did
not think it wise to attempt an issue with the
<i>Agamemnon</i> Nelson left him to his own devices.
He anchored off Toulon, on the 5th October, to find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Lord Hood “very much pleased” with him. This
must have been particularly gratifying after so luckless
a voyage, but what he most desired was action.</p>

<p>Within a few days of his arrival he received sealed
orders from the Admiral directing him to join Commodore
Linzee off Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia. His
longing to get at the enemy was to be satisfied in an
unexpected manner. When he was nearing the island
just before dawn on the morning of the 22nd October,
five strange sail made their appearance. Later they
resolved themselves into four of the enemy’s frigates
and a brig. After an engagement which lasted nearly
four hours and was ably contested on both sides, the
action terminated in the French <i>Melpomène</i> being
reduced to “a shattered condition,” and the <i>Agamemnon</i>
having her “topmast shot to pieces, main-mast,
mizen-mast, and fore-yard badly wounded”&mdash;the last
expression is typically Nelsonian. The Frenchmen
did not attempt to renew the fight; Nelson was prevented
from doing so because “The <i>Agamemnon</i> was so
cut to pieces, as to be unable to haul the wind towards
them.” The enemy’s squadron made for Corsica,
Nelson for Cagliari, according to orders, with one man
killed and six wounded.</p>

<p>When Nelson joined hands with Linzee he found
that the immediate business in hand was to endeavour
to bring the Bey of Tunis to reason, in other words, to
the British side. The Bey was an exceedingly crafty
individual who, believing that the best time for making
hay is when the sun shines, had sided with the French
because he saw an immediate financial return. Another
object was to secure a convoy which had put in at
Tunis under a sail-of-the-line, the <i>Duquesne</i> (84) and
four frigates, the force with which Nelson had already
dealt. As the Bey had purchased the cargoes of the
merchantmen at a handsome profit, he was not disposed
to change his policy. Nelson hated pacific overtures;
he was all for contest on the open sea. “Thank God,”
he is able to write to William Suckling, his uncle, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the 5th December 1793, “Lord Hood, whom Linzee
sent to for orders how to act, after having negotiated,
ordered me from under his command, and to command
a Squadron of Frigates off Corsica and the Coast of
Italy, to protect our trade, and that of our new Ally,
the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and to prevent any Ship
or Vessel, of whatever Nation, from going into the
port of Genoa. I consider this command as a very
high compliment,&mdash;there being five older Captains in
the Fleet....</p>

<p>“Corsica, December 8th:&mdash;I have been in sight of
the French Squadron all day, at anchor; they cannot
be induced to come out, notwithstanding their great
superiority....”</p>

<p>On the 19th of the same month Lord Hood vacated
Toulon.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> The troops of the National Convention,
aided by the consummate skill of Napoleon Bonaparte,
a young officer then beginning his amazing career, had
proved too powerful for the British, Spanish, Piedmontese
and Neapolitan forces. The British fleet
carried away no fewer than 14,000 fugitives from
the doomed city, which for hours afterwards was given
up to pillage. “Everything which domestic Wars
produce usually, is multiplied at Toulon,” Nelson writes
to his wife. “Fathers are here [<i>i.e.</i> Leghorn] without
their families, families without their fathers. In short,
all is horror.... Lord Hood put himself at the head
of the flying troops, and the admiration of every one;
but the torrent was too strong. Many of our posts
were carried without resistance; at others, which the
English occupied, every one perished. I cannot write
all: my mind is deeply impressed with grief. Each
teller makes the scene more horrible. Lord Hood
showed himself the same collected good Officer which
he always was.” The siege of Toulon was a qualified
success. The place was lost, but a dozen French ships
and the naval stores were set on fire, and four sail-of-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>the-line,
three frigates, and several smaller vessels were
secured as prizes. To cripple the French navy was the
most desired of all objects.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nelson’s division was blockading Corsica,
which had passed from the Republic of Genoa into the
hands of the French in 1768, to the disgust of the
patriotic party headed by Pascal Paoli. It was arranged
that Hood should assist the latter to rid the island
of the hated “tyrants,” and that in due course it
should be ceded to Great Britain. In the preliminary
negotiations Nelson was represented by Lieutenant
George Andrews, brother of the young lady to whom
Nelson had become attached during his visit to France
in 1783;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> the final arrangements were made by a
commission of which the gallant Sir John Moore was a
member. Hood joined Nelson on the 27th January
1794, and on the following day the fleet encountered
“the hardest gale almost ever remembered here.”
The <i>Agamemnon</i> “lost every sail in her,” her consorts
were dispersed “over the face of the waters.” This
delayed the landing of the troops Hood had brought
with him, but Nelson had already made a preliminary
skirmish on his own account near San Fiorenzo, the
first object of the admiral’s attack. He landed 120
soldiers and seamen, emptied a flour storehouse, ruined
a water-mill, and returned without the loss of a man,
notwithstanding the efforts of the French gunboats
to annihilate the little force. Similar expeditions were
undertaken at the beginning of February, when four
polaccas, loaded with wine for the enemy’s fleet, were
burned, four other vessels set on fire, a similar number
captured, and about 1,000 tuns of wine demolished.</p>

<p>On the 7th of the same month the inhabitants of
Rogliani showed National colours, and the Tree of
Liberty&mdash;the emblem of the French Revolution&mdash;was
planted. Nelson struck a flag flying on the old castle
with his own hand, and ordered the tree to be cut down.
More craft and wine were destroyed. Paoli was highly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
gratified by this performance, carried out in the true
Nelson spirit, and shortly afterwards the Captain tells
his wife with conscious pride, “I have had the pleasure
to fulfil the service I had been employed upon, since
leaving Tunis, neither allowing provisions nor troops
to get into Corsica,”&mdash;which he describes later as
“a wonderfully fine Island”&mdash;“nor the Frigates to
come out.”</p>

<p>Hood now took over the command at San Fiorenzo
and sent Nelson to blockade Bastia. The latter calculated
that “it would require 1000 troops, besides seamen,
Corsicans, etc., to make any successful attempt”
against the place. Lieutenant-General David Dundas,
the commander of the military forces, refused his aid unless
considerable reinforcements came to hand, although
he had at his disposal over 1700 regulars and artillerymen.
Hood, relying on Nelson’s statements to a certain
extent, endeavoured to persuade Dundas that the task
was by no means so difficult as he imagined, but the
military authority positively refused to listen to the
project. The General entered into the arrangements
for the capture of San Fiorenzo with more goodwill,
for in his opinion it was a less formidable undertaking.
Without in any way disparaging the exertions of the
troops it must be admitted that the gallant conduct of
the sailors, who dragged heavy guns up the heights in
order to place them in a position to cannonade the
tower of Mortello, which commanded the situation,
contributed largely to the success of the operation.
Dundas and Linzee attacked this formidable fortification
from the bay with a sail-of-the-line and a frigate on
the 8th February with ill success. Its defenders hurled
hot shot at the vessels with such precision that they
were obliged to move to a less dangerous position.
The tower was bombarded from the steeps for two
days before its garrison surrendered. Meanwhile
Lieutenant-Colonel John Moore had carried the batteries
of Fornelli, which led directly to the fall of San Fiorenzo
on the 17th instant. The French retreated to Bastia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
on the opposite side of the promontory, where Nelson
was exerting himself to the utmost. The British troops
marched to within three miles of the town, as noted
below, and were then ordered to return to San Fiorenzo.</p>

<p>On the 23rd February the <i>Agamemnon</i> and two
frigates dislodged the French from a battery of six
guns; “they to a man quitted the works.” For Lord
Hood’s encouragement he sent him word that shot
and shells had been hurled at the vessels “without
doing us any damage of consequence: our guns were
so exceedingly well pointed, that not one shot was
fired in vain.... Indeed, my Lord, I wish the troops
were here: Bastia, I am sure, in its present state,
would soon fall.”</p>

<p>In describing “our little brush” to his wife, he says
it “happened at the moment when part of our Army
made their appearance on the hills over Bastia, they
having marched over land from St Fiorenzo, which is
only twelve miles distant. The General sent an express
to Lord Hood at Fiorenzo to tell him of it. What a
noble sight it must have been! indeed, on board it was
the grandest thing I ever saw. If I had carried with
me five hundred troops, to a certainty I should have
stormed the Town, and I believe it might have been
carried.... You cannot think how pleased Lord
Hood has been with my attack on Sunday last, or
rather my repelling of an attack which the Enemy
made on me.”</p>

<p>Nelson’s ardent temperament, his longing to be up
and doing, made him think bitter things of Dundas. He
confides to his Journal on the 3rd March 1794 that
it is his firm opinion that if the <i>Agamemnon</i> and the
attendant frigates could batter down the sea-wall and
then land 500 troops they would “to a certainty carry
the place.” “God knows what it all means,” he writes
to his wife with reference to the general’s retreat.
“Lord Hood is gone to St Fiorenzo to the Army, to
get them forward again.... My seamen are now
what British seamen ought to be, to you I may say it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
almost invincible: they really mind shot no more than
peas.”</p>

<p>The delay was simply playing into the hands of the
enemy, who occupied the time in adding to the defences
of the town. One can imagine with what glee Nelson
scribbled in his Journal, under date of the 11th March,
“<i>Romney</i> joined me from Lord Hood: brought me
letters to say that General Dundas was going Home,
and that he hoped and trusted the troops would once
more move over the Hill.” The crew of the <i>Agamemnon</i>
suffered no little privation. “We are absolutely without
water, provisions, or stores of any kind, not a piece
of canvas, rope, twine, or a nail in the Ship; but we
cheerfully submit to it all, if it but turns out for the
advantage and credit of our Country.”</p>

<p>Dundas was succeeded by General Abraham D’Aubant,
an appointment which gave the Captain of the <i>Agamemnon</i>
no satisfaction, for he also thought it improper to
attack Bastia. Not to carry to a finish a project already
begun was considered by Nelson “a National disgrace.”
Hood determined to act contrary to the opinions of his
military colleague. “I am to command the Seamen landed
from the Fleet,” Nelson tells his brother. “I feel for the
honour of my Country, and had rather be beat than not
make the attack. If we do not try we never can be
successful. I own I have no fears for the final issue:
it will be conquest, certain we will deserve it.” “When
was a place ever yet taken without an attempt?”
he asks Sir William Hamilton. “We must endeavour
to deserve success; it is certainly not in our power to
command it.... My dear Sir, when was before the
time that 2,000 British troops, as good as ever marched,
were not thought equal to attack 800 French troops,
allowing them to be in strong works? What would
the immortal Wolfe have done? as he did, beat the
Enemy, if he perished in the attempt. Our Irregulars
are surely as good as the Enemy’s; and in numbers
we far exceed them. I truly feel sorrow, but I have
hope and confidence that all will end well.” Again,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
“We are but few, but of the right sort: our General at
San Fiorenzo not giving us one of the five Regiments
he has there lying idle.”</p>

<p>On the 4th April 1794 a definite start was made.
Some 1400 troops and sailors, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Villettes and Nelson respectively, landed at
the tower of Miomo, some three miles to the north of
the town. “At noon the Troops encamped about
2,500 yards from the citadel of Bastia, near a high
rock.” The night was employed in felling trees for
the purpose of constructing an abattis, a temporary
defence formed by placing trees with their boughs
sharpened to a point in such a position as to obstruct
the enemy and at the same time afford a certain amount
of cover for the riflemen. The getting up of the guns
and ammunition “was performed with an activity
and zeal seldom exceeded.” The French began firing
on the night of the 9th and kept it up until daylight
without inflicting injury on a single man, although the
tents were considerably damaged. After sending a flag
of truce to no effect, Hood began the siege in earnest on
the 11th. On that day the frigate <i>Proselyte</i> was set on
fire by the enemy’s red-hot shot, and as her captain could
not get her off the shore, he set his ship on fire in several
places and burnt her to the water’s edge so that she
might not fall into the hands of the hated Frenchmen.</p>

<p>“Only recollect that a brave man dies but once,
a coward all his life long,” Nelson writes to his wife
at the beginning of May, when fighting was of daily
occurrence and many a brave man fell on either side.
His only fear was that D’Aubant might alter his mind
and advance with his troops “when Bastia is about
to surrender, and deprive us of part of our glory.”
This is exactly what happened. On the 19th May the
troops from San Fiorenzo were seen marching over the
hills. Three days later, as the result of negotiations
begun by the enemy, the French colours were struck
and the Union Jack hoisted, and on the 24th “the
most glorious sight that an Englishman can experience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
and which, I believe, none but an Englishman could
bring about, was exhibited;&mdash;4,500 men laying down
their arms to less than 1,000 British soldiers, who were
serving as Marines.” Nelson gives the number of
British killed at 19, wounded 37, and of the enemy
203 killed, wounded 540, “most of whom are dead.”
He himself received “a sharp cut in the back.” Not
until the end of January 1795 did he confess to his
wife that he had information given to him “of the
enormous number of Troops we had to oppose us; but
my own honour, Lord Hood’s honour, and the honour
of our Country, must have all been sacrificed, had I
mentioned what I knew; therefore, you will believe,
what must have been my feelings during the whole
Siege, when I had often proposals made to me by men,
now rewarded, to write to Lord Hood to raise the Siege.”</p>

<p>Calvi, in the north-west of Corsica, was next attacked.
“Dragging cannon up steep mountains, and carrying
shot and shells, has been our constant employment”;
“I am very busy, yet own I am in all my glory: except
with you, [Mrs Nelson] I would not be any where but
where I am, for the world”; “Hallowell<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and myself
take, each one, twenty-four hours of duty at the
advanced battery,” are extracts from some of Nelson’s
letters and despatches at this period. On the 12th
July 1794 he modestly confesses to Hood that “I got
a little hurt this morning: not much, as you may
judge by my writing,” but in his Journal he notes, “at
seven o’clock, I was much bruised in the face and eyes
by sand from the works struck by shot.” The “little
hurt” proved far otherwise, and Nelson subsequently
became permanently blind in the right eye. At the
moment he attached little or no importance to the
injury: “Hallowell and myself are both well, except
my being half blinded by these fellows, who have given
me a smart slap in the face, for which I am their <em>debtor</em>,
but hope not to be so long”; “My right eye is cut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
entirely down; but the Surgeons flatter me I shall
not entirely lose my sight of that eye. At present I
can distinguish light from dark, but no object: it
confined me one day, when, thank God, I was enabled
to attend to my duty. I feel the want of it; but, such
is the chance of War, it was within a hair’s breadth of
taking off my head.” To Mrs Nelson he tones down
the news considerably: “Except a very slight scratch
towards my right eye, I have received no hurt whatever:
so you see I am not the worse for Campaigning:
but I cannot say I have any wish to go on with it.
This day [4th August 1794] I have been four months
landed, except a few days when we were after the
French Fleet, and I feel almost qualified to pass my
examination as a besieging General.”</p>

<p>Nelson not unnaturally felt himself slighted when
his name did not appear in the list of wounded. However,
he consoled himself by saying, “Never mind, I’ll
have a <cite>Gazette</cite> of my own.”</p>

<p>As the result of negotiations between the enemy and
General Stuart, the commander of the 1500 soldiers
who had taken part in the siege, the French garrison
marched out with the honours of war on the 10th
August, a proceeding not at all in keeping with Nelson’s
ideas. However, it was not for him to decide, and he
had the satisfaction of knowing that he had materially
assisted in the conquest of Corsica. He was specially
delighted with the thought that in future the enemy’s
navy would be deprived of the pine, tar, pitch, and
hemp which the island had formerly sent to Toulon.</p>

<p>Nelson now looked forward to reaching the quiet
waters of Spithead before the end of the year. In this
he was disappointed. Hood returned to Toulon, where
French naval preparations were going on apace, and
Nelson was sent with the <i>Agamemnon</i> to Leghorn in
order that his ship might refit and his men have a little
rest after their arduous exertions in Corsica. On his
own showing, he was “the best in health, but every
other Officer is scarcely able to crawl.” When ready<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
for further service Nelson joined the admiral off Toulon,
from whence he proceeded to Genoa “to keep peace
and harmony” with that Republic by enforcing its
neutrality. This mission was not of long duration, and
on the last day of September 1794 he was directed to
proceed off Gourjean and place himself under the orders
of Vice-Admiral Hotham, Hood’s successor as Commander-in-chief
in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>At this stage of our story it may not be unfitting to

War and in 1805:</p>

<p>When we come to compare the Navy of Nelson’s day
with that of our own, the result is astounding. The
estimates for 1910&ndash;11 amount to £40,603,700. Of this
sum, £13,279,830 is for ships either under construction
or about to be laid down. There are 95 battleships and
first-class cruisers afloat or building, and there is a total
strength of 710 vessels, including torpedo gunboats,
destroyers, torpedo boats, and submarines.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> The entire
<em>personnel</em>, exclusive of the reserves, numbers 131,000.</p>

<p>The accompanying illustration gives an exact idea of
the enormous difference in size between the <i>Victory</i> and
the <i>Hercules</i>. The former, launched in 1765, has a gross
tonnage of 2,164; the latter&mdash;at the time of writing, the
largest British battleship afloat&mdash;has a displacement of
20,250 tons, over nine times that of the <i>Victory</i>.
Nelson’s flagship is still afloat, but who can tell when
the <i>Hercules</i> will be obsolete? Progress demands many
and costly victims.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> French fleet at Toulon mustered fifteen
ships; Hotham had fourteen at his disposal,
including one Neapolitan sail-of-the-line. On
the 8th March 1795 it was known that the enemy was
at sea with the object of retaking Corsica, but it was
not until the morning of the 13th, that the Admiral
flew the signal for a general chase. While this was
proceeding the <i>Ça-Ira</i> (84) collided with the <i>Victorie</i>,
which precluded her from keeping up with her consorts.
Seizing his opportunity, the captain of the British
frigate <i>Inconstant</i> (36) pounced down upon the huge
battleship and immediately brought her to action.
A French frigate, the <i>Vestale</i>, then went to the assistance
of the <i>Ça-Ira</i>, and took her in tow. Considerable
damage had been done on board the <i>Inconstant</i> owing
to the double fire to which she was subjected. Nelson,
keenly alert to the slightest advantage, got abreast
of the two Frenchmen, and continued to wage a gallant
fight for nearly two hours until called off by Hotham
because of the near approach of several of the enemy’s
ships. The action was thereby rendered indecisive.
Nelson describes the <i>Ça-Ira</i> as “absolutely large enough
to take <i>Agamemnon</i> in her hold. I never saw such a
ship before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
During the night the <i>Sans Culottes</i> (120) separated
from her consorts, and the <i>Censeur</i> (74), with the
damaged <i>Ça-Ira</i> in tow, was also unable to keep up
with the remainder of the French fleet. This enabled
the <i>Bedford</i> (74) and the <i>Captain</i> (74) to attempt to
capture them on the following morning. The British
ships, as they bore down on the enemy, were received
by a tremendous fire, which they could not return.
For nearly an hour and a half the fight was sustained
until the <i>Captain</i> was little more than a floating wreck,
and the distressed state of the <i>Bedford</i> made her recall
imperative. Eventually the <i>Ça-Ira</i> and the <i>Censeur</i>
surrendered to other vessels of the fleet. “On the
14th,” Nelson relates with reference to the <i>Agamemnon</i>,
“although one of the Van-ships, and in close Action
on one side and distant Action on the other for upwards
of three hours, yet our neighbours suffered most
exceedingly, whilst we comparatively suffered nothing.
We had only six men slightly wounded. Our sails
were ribbons, and all our ropes were ends. Had
our good Admiral have followed the blow, we should
probably have done more, but the risk was thought
too great.” His ambition is aflame when he considers
the possibilities of the day. “In short, I wish to be
an Admiral, and in the command of the English Fleet;
I should very soon either do much, or be ruined. My
disposition cannot bear tame and slow measures....
At one period I am ‘the dear Nelson,’ ‘the amiable
Nelson,’ ‘the fiery Nelson’: however nonsensical these
expressions are, they are better than censure, and we
are all subject and open to flattery.”</p>

<p>Several weeks were spent in refitting, a necessary
process too slowly carried out. Meanwhile six French
vessels slipped out of Brest harbour and made their
way to Toulon. Then there was delay in sending
reinforcements not at all to Nelson’s liking. He desires
“a complete victory,” and his correspondence
betrays his anxiety for the appearance of Hood, “the
best Officer, take him altogether, that England has to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
boast of.” His absence was “a great national loss;”
Hotham’s continued appearance, although he did not
definitely say so, a calamity.</p>

<p>On the 6th June 1795 Nelson was appointed a Colonel
of Marines, the welcome intelligence being conveyed
to him by his father. This meant an increase of income
not to be despised, as well as “an appointment certainly
most flattering to me, as it marks to the world an
approbation of my conduct.”</p>

<p>Nelson, with the <i>Agamemnon</i> and a small squadron
of frigates, was now sent “to co-operate with the
Austrian General de Vins, in driving the French out
of the Riviera of Genoa,” and “to put an actual stop
to all trade between Genoa, France, and the places
occupied by the armies of France,” the invasion of
Italy then being an object much to be desired by the
Republicans. On the 6th of July he sighted a French
fleet of seventeen sail and six frigates, an overpowering
force it would have been madness to attack had the
opportunity been given to him. His little squadron
was chased to San Fiorenzo, where Hotham was stationed
but unable to get out owing to contrary winds. It
was not until the 13th that the enemy was again
seen. There was a general chase and a partial action:
“Hotham has no head for enterprise, perfectly satisfied
that each month passes without any losses on our
side,” is Nelson’s criticism.</p>

<p>He still endeavoured to be more or less of a freelance.
“I am acting, not only without the orders of
my Commander-in-chief,” he tells his wife, “but in
some measure contrary to them. However, I have
not only the support of his Majesty’s Ministers, both
at Turin and Genoa, but a consciousness that I am
doing what is right and proper for the service of our
King and Country. Political courage in an Officer is
as highly necessary as military courage.” His position
was difficult in the extreme, for while Genoa posed as
a neutral the French did very much as they pleased,
and the Austrian Army, subsidised by England, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
“slow beyond all description.” He found it impossible
to patrol the coast as he would have done
had he been able to procure sufficient cruisers and
transports. However, he managed to secure a convoy
of provisions and ammunition, various attacks were
made, and for more than a year his service was one of
continual worry and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>With the resignation of Hotham and the coming of
Sir John Jervis in November 1795 the naval policy
in the Mediterranean underwent a change. The latter
officer believed in watching an enemy’s port at a convenient
distance so as to render pursuit easy if necessary.
With the exception of two or three squadrons on special
service the fleet therefore took up its station off Toulon.</p>

<p>The victory of the French at the battle of Loano, on
the 24th November 1795, was followed by their occupation
of the Riviera of Genoa as a matter of course, the
Austrians retreating into Piedmont. A certain amount
of blame was laid on Nelson, who, as already noted,
was in the neighbourhood of Genoa in order to see
that the pretended neutrality was observed. Rumour
had it that he and his officers had connived at the
landing of supplies for the French army. This drew
from him an indignant letter to Lord Grenville. It
was certain that Genoa was a hot-bed of sedition and
French partisanship. An Austrian commissary had
been robbed, and Voltri temporarily captured; it was
said that an insurrection of the peasantry was imminent
and that men were publicly enlisted for service in the
French army. The recruits were to embark in French
ships lying in the port of Genoa and in coasters at
Borghetto and to proceed to a landing-place near
Voltri. Nelson, far from sympathising with the malcontents,
prevented the sailing of the expedition by
leaving Vado Bay and proceeding to the scene of
the trouble. He placed the <i>Agamemnon</i> across the
harbour-mouth and allowed none of the enemy’s vessels
to leave.</p>

<p>It is a mournful letter which he pens to Sir Gilbert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Elliot, Viceroy of Corsica, on the 4th December 1795.
“My campaign is closed,” he begins, “by the defeat
of the Austrian Army, and the consequent loss of Vado
and every place in the Riviera of Genoa, and I am on my
way to refit poor <i>Agamemnon</i> and her miserable Ship’s
company at Leghorn. We are, indeed, Sir, worn out;
except six days I have never been one hour off the
station.” The despatch is too lengthy to quote in full,
but it is significant that he adds, “My being at Genoa,
although contrary to my inclination, has been the
means of saving from 8000 to 10,000 men, and amongst
others, General de Vins himself, who escaped by the
road, which, but for me, the Enemy would have occupied.
I must, my dear Sir, regret not having more force.”</p>

<p>Nelson, who now made the acquaintance of Jervis,
early discerned that his senior officer was a man more
after his own heart than either Hotham or Sir Hyde
Parker, who had held the command during the interim.
He was offered either a 90-gun or a 74-gun ship, but
preferred to keep to the well-tried <i>Agamemnon</i>, for
whose crew he cherished a fond affection. He was
confident that in the succeeding Spring the victorious
French would “make a great exertion to get into
Italy.” This they did, but by land and not by sea as
Nelson anticipated. After refitting Nelson was still
kept on the lookout, descents on Italy being thought
not improbable, but in February 1796 he was off Toulon
for a short time to spy on the doings of the French
fleet. His health was by no means good: “I am
grown old and battered to pieces, and require some
repairs. However, on the whole, I have stood the fag
better than could be expected.” In the following
month Nelson became a Commodore, hoisting his
distinguishing pennant on the <i>Captain</i> (74) a little
later, the condition of the ship which had served him
so long and so well being such that she could no longer
be patched up to withstand the gales without being
overhauled in England.</p>

<p>The war was going from bad to worse so far as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
allies were concerned. The armies of the King of
Sardinia and Piedmont and of the Emperor of the
Holy Roman Empire acted in separate bodies, whereas
they would have been superior to the enemy had they
concentrated. The battle of Montenotte, fought on
the 12th April 1796, took the Austrians completely
by surprise, and enabled Napoleon to boast that his
“title of nobility” dated from this great victory.
Millesimo, Dego, Mondovi, and Cherasco fell, France
and Sardinia made peace, followed by an armistice
between Naples and the Republic which preluded a
cessation of hostilities in the following October.</p>

<p>Although Nelson was gradually rising in the service
he was by no means a wealthy man. “If we have a
Spanish war,” he confides to his brother on the 20th
June 1796, “I shall yet hope to make something this
war. At present, I believe I am worse than when I
set out&mdash;I mean in point of riches, for if credit and
honour in the service are desirable, I have my full
share. Opportunities have been frequently offered me,
and I have never lost one of distinguishing myself, not
only as a gallant man, but as having a head; for, of
the numerous plans I have laid, not one has failed, nor
of opinions given, has one been in the event wrong. It
is this latter which has perhaps established my character
more than the others; and I hope to return in
as good health as I set out with.”</p>

<p>The French having taken possession of Leghorn,
Nelson was ordered to blockade that important port.
At the same time he received intelligence from Sir
Gilbert Elliot that there was a likelihood of the enemy
making an attempt on the fortress of Porto Ferrajo
in order that Elba might be used as a stepping-stone
to Corsica. The place was secured by the British
without resort to the sword, the good understanding
between the military and naval forces being in marked
contrast to Nelson’s previous experience at Bastia,
“a farther proof of what may be effected by the hearty
co-operation of the two services.” He was soon back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
at his former station, carrying out his work efficiently
and to Jervis’s complete satisfaction. The Commodore’s
letter to his wife, dated the 2nd August 1796, reflects
his high spirits and relates two anecdotes of more
than ordinary interest. After telling Mrs Nelson that
“Wherever there is anything to be done, there Providence
is sure to direct my steps. Credit must be given
me in spite of envy,” he proceeds as follows:</p>

<p>“Even the French respect me: their Minister at
Genoa, in answering a Note of mine, when returning
some wearing apparel that had been taken, said, ‘Your
Nation, Sir, and mine, are made to show examples of
generosity, as well as of valour, to all the people of
the earth.’...</p>

<p>“I will also relate another anecdote, all vanity to
myself, but you will partake of it: A person sent me
a letter, and directed as follows, ‘Horatio Nelson, Genoa.’
On being asked how he could direct in such a manner,
his answer, in a large party, was ‘Sir, there is but
one Horatio Nelson in the world.’ The letter certainly
came immediately. At Genoa, where I have stopped
all their trade, I am beloved and respected, both by
the Senate and lower Order. If any man is fearful of
his Vessel being stopped, he comes and asks me; if
I give him a Paper, or say, ‘All is right,’ he is contented.
I am known throughout Italy; not a Kingdom,
or State, where my name will be forgotten. This is
my Gazette.”</p>

<p>Towards the end of September Jervis was directed
by the Home Authorities to assist the Viceroy in the
evacuation of Corsica, “and with the fleet to retreat
down the Mediterranean.” This was deemed advisable
by the knowledge that war was likely to be declared
against Great Britain by Spain, that Power having
entered into an offensive and defensive alliance with
the ever victorious French Republic on the 12th September
1796. Nelson, who had but recently assisted
at the capture of the little island of Capraja, which he
hoped with some reason would “give additional security<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
to the Kingdom of Corsica,” was not pleased when
duty called him to undertake the evacuation of the
country so inseparably associated with Napoleon.
“God knows what turn the minds of the Corsicans
may take when the measure comes to be known,” he
tells Jervis. Leaving the Mediterranean was a sore
trial, “a measure which I cannot approve. They
at home do not know what this Fleet is capable of
performing; anything, and everything. Much as I
shall rejoice to see England”&mdash;he was writing to his wife&mdash;“I
lament our present orders in sackcloth and ashes,
so dishonourable to the dignity of England, whose
Fleets are equal to meet the World in arms; and of
all the Fleets I ever saw, I never beheld one in point
of officers and men equal to Sir John Jervis’s, who is
a Commander-in-chief able to lead them to glory.”</p>

<p>The Commodore was next instructed to embark
the garrison of Porto Ferrajo preparatory to the abandonment
of Elba. Certain of the troops were then
to be landed at Gibraltar and the remainder at Lisbon:
“The object of our Fleet in future is the defence of
Portugal, and keeping in the Mediterranean the Combined
Fleets,” namely those of Spain and France.
While on his way to carry out his important mission
Nelson was to meet with a surprising adventure.</p>

<p class="p0 b1 right">
<span class="smcap">Sir Gilbert Elliot.</span>
</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Sir John Jervis</span> had concentrated his fleet
in Gibraltar Bay. Nelson was making his way
from thence to Elba in the <i>Minerve</i>, accompanied
by the <i>Blanche</i>, both 32-gun frigates. All
went well until late in the evening of the 19th December
1796, when they fell in with two Spanish frigates named
the <i>Santa Sabina</i> (40) and the <i>Ceres</i> (40) off Cartagena.
The Commodore at once instructed Captain Cockburn
to bring the <i>Minerve</i> to close action with the former.
The struggle which ensued lasted for nearly three
hours. The lengthy resistance of the enemy is proof
that there were still gallant officers in the naval service
of what was once the mightiest Sea Power in the world,
now long since fallen from her high estate. Captain
Don Jacobo Stuart fought his ship with praiseworthy
calm and daring. Not until 164 of the 286 men who
comprised the crew of the <i>Santa Sabina</i> had been killed
or wounded did the Don strike his colours. The vessel
had then lost both main and fore-masts, and the
deck must have resembled a shambles. The <i>Blanche</i>
had also behaved well, although the action was trifling
compared with the determined encounter between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
other vessels. The approach of three additional ships
prevented the captain of the <i>Blanche</i> from following
up his advantage and capturing the <i>Ceres</i>, which had
hauled down her colours and sustained considerable
damage to her sails and rigging.</p>

<p>Nelson’s prize was put in charge of Lieutenants
Culverhouse and Hardy and taken in tow by the <i>Minerve</i>.
They had not proceeded far before a third Spanish
frigate came up and engaged the <i>Minerve</i>, necessitating
the casting-off of the <i>Santa Sabina</i>, thereby leaving the
two young, but able, junior officers to their own resources.
The encounter lasted a little over half-an-hour, when the
frigate having had enough of Nelson’s pommelling hauled
off. The vessels from which Captain D’Arcy Preston of
the <i>Blanche</i> had escaped were now approaching, their
commanders having been attracted by the sound of
distant firing. Dawn revealed them to Nelson as two
sail-of-the-line and a frigate. By hoisting English
colours above the Spanish flag on the prize the enemy’s
Admiral was attracted to her, a ruse which enabled the
<i>Minerve</i> and the <i>Blanche</i> to escape, for it would have
been foolish for Nelson to run the risk of sacrificing them
because of the prize crew. Indeed, the situation was so
perilous that Nelson afterwards wrote to Sir Gilbert Elliot,
“We very narrowly escaped visiting a Spanish prison.”
Neither before nor since have British Tars behaved in
finer fashion. They sailed the <i>Santa Sabina</i> until she
was practically a hulk, when she was recaptured.</p>

<p>“The merits of every officer and man in the <i>Minerve</i>
and her Prize,” Nelson reports to Jervis, “were
eminently conspicuous through the whole of this arduous
day.” He likewise said the kindest things of his
antagonist: “My late prisoner, a descendant from
the Duke of Berwick, son of James II., was my brave
opponent; for which I have returned him his sword, and
sent him in a Flag of truce to Spain ... he was reputed
the best Officer in Spain, and his men were worthy of
such a Commander; he was the only surviving Officer.”
He reserved more picturesque details for his brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
“When I hailed the Don,” he relates, “and told
him, ‘This is an English Frigate,’ and demanded his
surrender or I would fire into him, his answer was noble,
and such as became the illustrious family from which
he is descended&mdash;‘This is a Spanish Frigate, and you
may begin as soon as you please.’ I have no idea of
a closer or sharper battle: the force to a gun the same,
and nearly the same number of men; we having two
hundred and fifty. I asked him several times to
surrender during the Action, but his answer was&mdash;‘No,
Sir; not whilst I have the means of fighting left.’
When only himself of all the Officers were left alive, he
hailed, and said he could fight no more, and begged
I would stop firing.” Culverhouse and Hardy, after
having been conveyed to Carthagena, were subsequently
exchanged for the unlucky but brave Don, and returned
to the <i>Minerve</i>.</p>

<p class="notbold">H.&nbsp;C. Seppings Wright</p></div></div>

<p>Nelson duly anchored at Porto Ferrajo, and met
with a lack of co-operation on the part of the military
authority similar to some of his previous experiences.
Lieutenant-General de Burgh, in command of the
troops, declined to evacuate the town. Nelson, having
no other alternative, removed the naval stores, left a
number of sloops and gunboats for use in emergency,
and sailed for Gibraltar, which he reached on the 9th
February 1797, having looked into the enemy’s ports
of Toulon and Cartagena on the way. Two days
later the Commodore again set out in his endeavour
to join Jervis, and was chased by two Spanish ships.
It was then that a memorable incident occurred in
the lives of both Nelson and Hardy, names inseparably
associated. A man fell overboard, and Hardy and a
crew in the jolly-boat hastened to the rescue. The
current was strong, the poor fellow sank, and the boat
rapidly drifted in the direction of one of the oncoming
vessels, so that Hardy stood a very good chance of
again falling into the hands of the enemy. “I’ll not
lose Hardy; back the mizen topsail,” shouted Nelson
without a moment’s hesitation. This was done, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the lieutenant and his sailors were rescued. The
Spaniards were completely put off their guard. Led
to imagine by the peculiar manœuvre of the <i>Minerve</i>
that other British ships had been sighted, they gave up
the chase. No further exciting incidents occurred as
the doughty frigate ploughed the blue waters of the
Mediterranean, although the Spanish fleet was passed
at night. On the 13th Nelson joined Jervis, off Cape
St Vincent, and was able to assure him that a battle
appeared imminent. “Every heart warmed to see
so brave and fortunate a warrior among us,” says
Lieutenant G.&nbsp;S. Parsons, then not quite thirteen years
of age and a first-class volunteer on board the <i>Barfleur</i>
(98). During the succeeding hours of darkness the
low and distant rumble of signal guns proved the truth
of the Commodore’s assertion. The enemy’s fleet of
twenty-seven sail-of-the-line and twelve 34-gun frigates
was certainly hastening in the direction of Jervis. It
had sailed from Cadiz for a very important purpose.
After concentrating with the Toulon fleet the allies were
to attempt to raise the English blockade of Brest, thus
releasing the important armament there, gain command
of the Channel, and invade Ireland. We shall have
occasion to notice that in later years Napoleon conceived
a similar idea. It is open to question whether Admiral
Don Josef de Cordova would have been quite so eager
for the fray had he known the full British strength.
He believed it to be nine sail-of-the-line, whereas fifteen
battleships and seven smaller vessels were awaiting
his coming. When the signal-lieutenant of the <i>Barfleur</i>
exclaimed of the oncoming leeward line of vessels,
“They loom like Beachy Head in a fog! By my soul,
they are thumpers, for I distinctly make out <em>four</em> tier
of ports in one of them, bearing an admiral’s flag,” he
expressed plain, honest fact. “Don Cordova, in the
<i>Santissima Trinidad</i>,” Jervis correctly surmised, “and
I trust in Providence that we shall reduce this mountain
into a mole hill before sunset.” The Spanish flag-ship
was the largest vessel afloat, and carried 130 guns.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
She must have towered above the insignificant <i>Captain</i>
(74), to which Nelson had transferred his broad pennant,
much like an elephant over a Shetland pony. Nor was
the <i>Santissima Trinidad</i> the only vessel built on what
was then considered to be colossal lines. No fewer
than six of the Spanish three-deckers carried 112 guns
each; two of them had 80 guns each, and seventeen
were 74-gun ships. England was represented by two
sail-of-the-line of 100 guns each, two of 98 each, ten
of 74 each, and one of 64.</p>

<p>“The British had formed one of the most beautiful
and close lines ever beheld,” Parsons tells us. “The
fog drew up like a curtain, and disclosed the grandest
sight I ever witnessed. The Spanish fleet, close on our
weather bow, were making the most awkward attempts
to form their line of battle, and they looked a complete
forest huddled together; their commander-in-chief,
covered with signals, and running free on his leeward
line, using his utmost endeavours to get them into
order; but they seemed confusion worse confounded.
I was certainly very young, but felt so elated as to walk
on my toes, by way of appearing taller, as I bore oranges
to the admiral and captain, selecting some for myself,
which I stored in a snug corner in the stern-galley, as
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Corps de réserve</i>. The breeze was just sufficient to
cause all the sails to sleep, and we were close hauled
on the starboard tack, with royals set, heading up for
the Spanish fleet. Our supporting ship, in the well-formed
line, happened to be the <i>Captain</i>, and Captain
Dacres hailed to say that he was desired by the vice-admiral
to express his pleasure at being supported
by Sir Horatio Nelson.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Men famous in British naval annals were present
at this memorable contest, fought on St Valentine’s
Day, 1797. Jervis was in the <i>Victory</i> (100), Troubridge
in the <i>Culloden</i> (74), Collingwood in the <i>Excellent</i>
(74), and Saumarez in the <i>Orion</i> (74). Twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
years before Troubridge and Nelson had sailed together
in the <i>Seahorse</i>; Collingwood was the Commodore’s
life-long friend, and Saumarez, whom the great little
man did not like, was to become second in command
at the battle of the Nile eighteen months later.</p>

<p>“England,” the Admiral averred, “was in need of
a victory,” and he gave her one. Jervis was indeed
a doughty champion of his country’s rights at sea.
“The British Admiral made the signal to prepare for
battle,” says an eye-witness. “As he walked the
quarter-deck the hostile numbers were reported to him,
as they appeared, by signal. ‘There are eight sail-of-the-line,
Sir John.’ ‘Very well, sir.’ ‘There are
twenty-five sail-of-the-line.’ ‘Very well, sir.’ ‘There
are twenty-seven sail, Sir John,’ and this was accompanied
by some remark on the great disparity of the
forces. ‘Enough, sir&mdash;no more of that: the die is
cast; and if there were fifty sail-of-the-line, I would
go through them.’” Sir Benjamin Hallowell-Carew,
then a supernumerary on the quarter-deck of the
<i>Victory</i>, disregarding the austerity of naval etiquette
and thinking only of the determined utterance of the
grim old veteran, so far forgot himself as to give the
Admiral a hearty slap on the back.</p>

<p>The Spanish fleet was in two divisions of twenty-one
and six sail-of-the-line respectively, separated by a
distance of some miles. Three of the main squadron
joined the latter a little later, while one “sailed away.”
Jervis’s fleet, in single column, separated the two
lines. By a skilful manœuvre he held in check the
smaller division and brought his ships to bear on the
larger, the <i>Culloden</i> being the first vessel to attack,
which elicited warm praise of Troubridge from Jervis.
The fight at once became general and was waged for
some time without decisive results. Then several of
the leading Spanish ships endeavoured to get round
the rear of the British. Had they succeeded in doing
so it would have enabled them to join the detached
leeward division and escape to Cadiz. Nelson at once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
discerned the project, and without hesitation placed
the <i>Captain</i> in the path of the oncoming ships. He
“dashed in among the Spanish van,” to quote Parsons,
“totally unsupported, leaving a break in the British
line&mdash;conduct totally unprecedented, and only to be
justified by the most complete success with which it
was crowned....”</p>

<p>The <i>Captain</i>, the smallest 74 in the fleet, stood a
good chance of being annihilated by the oncoming
squadron of Spanish ships, which included the <i>Santissima
Trinidad</i>, a gigantic four-decker. Lieutenant-Colonel
Drinkwater, who was an eye-witness, tells us
that for a considerable time Nelson “had to contend
not only with her, but with her seconds ahead and astern,
of three decks each. While he maintained this unequal
combat, which was viewed with admiration, mixed
with anxiety, his friends were flying to his support:
and the enemy’s attention was soon directed to the
<i>Culloden</i>, Captain Troubridge; and, in a short time
after, to the <i>Blenheim</i>, of 90 guns, Captain Frederick;
who, very opportunely, came to his assistance.</p>

<p>“The intrepid conduct of the Commodore staggered
the Spanish admiral, who already appeared to waver
in pursuing his intention of joining the ships cut off
by the British fleet; when the <i>Culloden’s</i> arrival, and
Captain Troubridge’s spirited support of the <i>Captain</i>,
together with the approach of the <i>Blenheim</i>, followed
by Rear-Admiral Parker, with the <i>Prince George</i>, <i>Orion</i>,
<i>Irresistible</i>, and <i>Diadem</i>, not far distant, determined
the Spanish admiral to change his design altogether,
and to make the signal for the ships of his main body
to haul their wind, and make sail on the larboard tack.</p>

<p>“Advantage was now apparent, in favour of the
British squadron, and not a moment was lost in improving
it. As the ships of Rear-Admiral Parker’s
division approached the enemy’s ships, in support of
the <i>Captain</i>, and her gallant seconds, the <i>Blenheim</i>
and <i>Culloden</i>, the cannonade became more animated
and impressive. The superiority of the British fire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
over that of the enemy, and its effects on the enemy’s
hulls and sails, were so evident that there was no longer
any hesitation in pronouncing a glorious termination
of the contest.</p>

<p>“The British squadron at this time was formed in
two divisions, both on the larboard tack<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>: Rear-Admiral
Parker, with the <i>Blenheim</i>, <i>Culloden</i>, <i>Prince
George</i>, <i>Captain</i>, <i>Orion</i>, and <i>Irresistible</i>, composed one
division, which was engaged with the enemy’s rear;
Sir John Jervis, with the other division, consisting of
the <i>Excellent</i>, <i>Victory</i>, <i>Barfleur</i>, <i>Namur</i>, <i>Egmont</i>, <i>Goliath</i>,
and <i>Britannia</i>, was pressing forward in support of his
advanced squadron, but had not yet approached the
real scene of action.</p>

<p>“While the British advanced squadron warmly
pressed the enemy’s centre and rear, the Admiral
meditated, with his division, a co-operation which
must effectually compel some of them to surrender.</p>

<p>“In the confusion of their retreat, several of the
enemy’s ships had doubled on each other; and, in
the rear, they were three or four deep. It was, therefore,
the British admiral’s design to reach the weather-most
of these ships; and, then, to bear up, and rake
them all in succession, with the seven ships composing
his division. His object, afterwards, was to pass on
to the support of his van division; which, from the
length of time they had been engaged, he judged might
be in want of it. The casual position, however, of the
rear ships of his van division, prevented his executing
this plan. The admiral, therefore, ordered the <i>Excellent</i>,
the leading ship of his own division, to bear up; and,
with the <i>Victory</i>, he himself passed to leeward of the
enemy’s rearmost and leewardmost ships; which,
though almost silenced in their fire, continued obstinately
to resist the animated attack of all their opponents.</p>

<p>“Captain Collingwood, in the <i>Excellent</i>, in obedience
to the admiral’s orders, passed between the two rearmost
ships of the enemy’s line; giving to the one most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
to windward, a 74, so effectual a broadside, in addition
to what had been done before, that her captain was
induced to submit. The <i>Excellent</i> afterwards bore
down on the ship to leeward, a three-decker: but,
observing the <i>Orion</i> engaged with her, and the <i>Victory</i>
approaching her, he threw into her only a few discharges
of musquetry, and passed on to the support
of the <i>Captain</i>, at that time warmly engaged with a
three-decker, carrying a flag. His interference here
was opportune, as the continual and long fire of the
<i>Captain</i> had almost expended the ammunition she
had at hand, and the loss of her fore-topmast, and
other injuries she had received in her rigging, had
rendered her nearly ungovernable.</p>

<p>“The Spanish three-decker had lost her mizen-mast;
and, before the <i>Excellent</i> arrived in her proper station
to open on this ship, the three-decker dropped astern
aboard of, and became entangled with, a Spanish
two-decker, that was her second. Thus doubled on
each other, the <i>Excellent</i> gave the two ships her fire;
and then moved forwards to assist the headmost ships
in their attack on the Spanish admiral, and the other
ships of the enemy’s centre.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, Sir John Jervis, disappointed in his
plan of raking the enemy’s rear ships, and having
directed, as before observed, the <i>Excellent</i> to bear up,
ordered the <i>Victory</i> to be placed on the lee-quarter of
the rearmost ship of the enemy, a three-decker; and
having, by signal, ordered the <i>Irresistible</i> and <i>Diadem</i>
to suspend their firing, threw into the three-decker
so powerful a discharge, that her commander, seeing
the <i>Barfleur</i> ... ready to second the <i>Victory</i>, thought
proper to strike to the British Commander-in-chief.
Two of the enemy’s ships had now surrendered; and
the <i>Lively</i> frigate, and <i>Diadem</i>, had orders to secure
the prizes. The next that fell were the two with which
Commodore Nelson was engaged.</p>

<p>“While Captain Collingwood so nobly stepped in
to his assistance, as already mentioned, Captain <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>R.&nbsp;W.
Miller, the Commodore’s captain, was enabled to
replenish his lockers with shot, and prepare for a renewal
of the fight. No sooner, therefore, had the
<i>Excellent</i> passed on, than the gallant Commodore
renewed the battle.</p>

<p>“The three-decker with which he was before engaged
having fallen aboard her second, that ship, of 84 guns,
became now the Commodore’s opponent. To her,
therefore, he directed a vigorous fire; nor was it feebly
returned, as the loss on board the <i>Captain</i> evinced,
nearly twenty men being killed and wounded in a very
few minutes. It was now that the various damages
already sustained by that ship, through the long and
arduous conflict which she had maintained, appearing
to render a continuance of the contest in the usual
way precarious, or perhaps impossible, that Commodore
Nelson, unable to bear the idea of parting with an
enemy of which he had so thoroughly assured himself,
instantly resolved on a bold and decisive measure;
and determined, whatever might be the event, to
attempt his opponent sword in hand. The boarders
were accordingly summoned, and orders given to lay
his ship, the <i>Captain</i>, on board the enemy.”</p>

<p>“At this time,” says Nelson, “the <i>Captain</i> having
lost her fore-topmast, not a sail, shroud, or rope left,
her wheel shot away, and incapable of further service
in the line, or in chase, I directed Captain Miller to put
the helm a-starboard, and calling for the Boarders,
ordered them to board. The Soldiers of the 69th
Regiment, with an alacrity which will ever do them
credit, and Lieutenant Pierson of the same Regiment,
were amongst the foremost on this service. The first
man who jumped into the Enemy’s mizen-chains was
Captain Berry, late my First Lieutenant (Captain
Miller was in the very act of going also, but I directed
him to remain); he was supported from our spritsail-yard,
which hooked in the mizzen-rigging. A soldier
of the 69th Regiment having broke the upper quarter-gallery
window, jumped in, followed by myself and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
others as fast as possible. I found the cabin-doors
fastened, and some Spanish Officers fired their pistols;
but having broke open the doors, the soldiers fired,
and the Spanish Brigadier (Commodore with a Distinguishing
Pendant) fell, as retreating to the quarter-deck,
on the larboard side, near the wheel. Having
pushed on the quarter-deck, I found Captain Berry in
possession of the poop, and the Spanish ensign hauling
down. I passed with my people and Lieutenant Pierson
on the larboard gangway to the forecastle, where I
met two or three Spanish Officers prisoners to my
seamen, and they delivered me their swords.</p>

<p>“At this moment, a fire of pistols or muskets opened
from the Admiral’s stern gallery of the <i>San Josef</i>,
I directed the soldiers to fire into her stern; and,
calling to Captain Miller, ordered him to send more
men into the <i>San Nicolas</i>, and directed my people to
board the First-rate, which was done in an instant,
Captain Berry assisting me into the main chains. At
this moment a Spanish Officer looked over the quarter-deck
rail, and said&mdash;‘they surrendered;’ from this
most welcome intelligence it was not long before I was
on the quarter-deck, when the Spanish Captain, with
a bow, presented me his Sword, and said the Admiral
was dying of his wounds below. I asked him, on his
honour, if the Ship were surrendered? he declared
she was; on which I gave him my hand, and desired
him to call to his Officers and Ship’s company, and tell
them of it&mdash;which he did; and on the quarter-deck
of a Spanish First-rate, extravagant as the story may
seem, did I receive the Swords of vanquished Spaniards:
which, as I received, I gave to William Fearney, one
of my bargemen, who put them with the greatest
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sangfroid</i> under his arm.”</p>

<p>Nelson afterwards went on board the <i>Irresistible</i>.
It was then late in the afternoon, and he did not think
it advisable to take possession of the <i>Santissima Trinidad</i>
because he was convinced that “a night Action with
a still very superior Fleet” must inevitably follow.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Jervis received the Commodore with great affection
and was not sparing with well-deserved praise. The
hero of the day was no less generous in acknowledging
the services of Collingwood. He described his conduct
as “noble and gallant.” Nelson had no truer friend
than the commander of the <i>Excellent</i>, whose admiration
for the Commodore’s genius knew no bounds. “The
highest rewards are due to you and <i>Culloden</i>:” Collingwood
replied, “you formed the plan of attack&mdash;we
were only accessories to the Dons’ ruin; for had they
got on the other tack, they would have been sooner
joined, and the business would have been less complete.”</p>

<p>While the interest of the fight centres about the
<i>Captain</i>, each ship contributed to the victory. In
addition to Nelson’s vessel, the <i>Colossus</i> and <i>Culloden</i>
were badly battered but fortunately the loss in men
was remarkably small. Four prizes fell to the British
fleet on St Valentine’s Day, 1797.</p>

<p>To his wife, Nelson confesses that “the more I think
of our late action, the more I am astonished; it absolutely
appears a dream.... The Spanish war will
give us a cottage and a piece of ground, which is all
I want. I shall come one day or other laughing back,
when we will retire from the busy scenes of life: I do
not, however, mean to be a hermit; the dons will give
us a little money.” This must not be taken too seriously,
for within forty-eight hours of the battle he had
confided to Sir Gilbert Elliot that “to take hereditary
Honours without a fortune to support the Dignity, is
to lower that Honour it would be my pride to support
in proper splendour.” He did not wish a “baronetage,”
but on the other hand, “There are Honours, which
die with the possessor, and I should be proud to accept,
if my efforts are thought worthy of the favour of my
King.” George III. created him a Knight of the Bath;
Jervis became Earl of St Vincent. Six days after the
battle Nelson was promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral
of the Blue, not as a reward for his meritorious conduct
but as his due according to seniority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
A beautiful gold casket containing the much-coveted
Freedom of the City and a sword of honour was given
to Sir Horatio, as we must now call him, by the Corporation
of London, and Norwich, where some of his school
days were spent, likewise conferred its Freedom upon
him. Nelson on his part presented the county town
of Norfolk with the sword of the Spanish Rear-Admiral
who had died of his wounds on board the <i>San Josef</i>.
Other cities extended “the right hand of friendship”
to the hero, including Bath and Bristol. Nelson’s
father was overcome when he heard of his son’s brilliant
success: “The height of glory to which your professional
judgment, united with a proper degree of
bravery, guarded by Providence, has raised you, few
sons, my dear child, attain to, and fewer fathers live
to see. Tears of joy have involuntarily trickled down
my furrowed cheek. Who could stand the force of
such general congratulation? The name and services
of Nelson have sounded throughout the City of Bath,
from the common ballad-singer to the public theatre.
Joy sparkles in every eye, and desponding Britain
draws back her sable veil, and smiles.”</p>

<p>Although he had clearly disobeyed Jervis’s order
for the ships to attack in succession, the Commodore’s
daring action had rendered the battle decisive. Sir
Robert Calder, the Captain of the Fleet, is said to have
protested against Nelson’s conduct, but the Admiral’s
reply, “If you ever commit such a breach of orders
I will forgive you,” was entirely worthy of the stern
old disciplinarian. Jervis was not one of those officers
who bestow praise on every possible occasion, both in
and out of season. He was just, and therefore recognised
the extremely valuable service which Nelson
had rendered to him. We shall have occasion to see
how Calder himself behaved at a certain critical period,
when a stroke of genius such as had been displayed
at St Vincent would have robbed Nelson of the glory
of Trafalgar.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">All</span> hopes on the part of Britain’s enemies for
the invasion of the British Isles were quashed
for a time by the victory off Cape St Vincent.
Although the distressed Spanish fleet reached Cadiz
safely, minus four sail-of-the-line which the British
had captured, there was no likelihood at the moment
of the ships showing their “noses” out of port, many
of the aforesaid noses being much out of joint. For
several weeks Nelson was engaged in a fruitless search
for a treasure-ship, convoyed by three sail-of-the-line,
supposed to be making for Spain; but in April 1797
he was directed by the Admiral to blockade Cadiz, a
task not altogether devoid of incident if for no other
reason than that no neutral vessel was permitted to
enter or leave the port without his permission. He
was particularly concerned as to the welfare of the
garrison at Elba. The Commander-in-Chief believed
that the soldiers were on their way to Gibraltar; Nelson
was of opinion that “If the French get out two sail-of-the-line,
which I am confident they may do, our
Troops are lost, and what a triumph would that be to
them!” At his own suggestion he was sent to Porto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Ferrajo to make enquiries about the luckless little
army. The convoy had started, and he met it off the
south of Corsica. He learned of Napoleon’s wonderful
success in the subjugation of Italy and the humbling
of Austria, admitting that “there seems no prospect
of stopping these extraordinary people,” the French.
Shifting from the <i>Captain</i>, which required to be docked,
he hoisted his rear-admiral’s flag on the <i>Theseus</i>, and
was given command of the inshore squadron of the
fleet blockading the great seaport, “in sight of the
whole Spanish Fleet. I am barely out of shot of a
Spanish Rear-Admiral.” The citizens not unnaturally
dreaded a bombardment; Nelson confessed, “I long to
be at them.” At the same time he reverted to the old
idea of a cottage in Norfolk. “The imperious call of
honour to serve my Country,” and a not ignoble desire
to add to his prize money in order to give his wife
“those little luxuries which you so highly merit,”
did not, however, permit him to give more than a
passing thought to retirement.</p>

<p>On the night of the 3rd July 1797 all the barges and
launches of the British blockading fleet, carrying carronades,
ammunition and pikes, were placed at Nelson’s
disposal by the Earl of St Vincent for the bombardment
of Cadiz. A spirited action took place between the
British and Spanish sailors, the latter using mortar
gunboats and armed launches. The Spanish met
with a repulse and three prizes were taken. Referring
to the blockade in his Autobiography, Nelson says:
“It was during this period that perhaps my personal
courage was more conspicuous than at any other part
of my life,” the remark obviously referring to the
following incident. The barge of the Commander of
the enemy’s gunboats came up alongside Nelson’s
little craft, containing thirteen persons in all, and a
desperate hand-to-hand fight ensued. The Rear-Admiral
would have lost his life had it not been for the
good services of John Sykes, the coxswain, one of
those humble heroes of whom one hears too little, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
predominant are the greater figures of history. The
enemy paid dearly for the exploit. Eighteen of the
crew were killed, several wounded, the Commander
was taken prisoner, and the boat captured. On the
5th of the same month Cadiz was again bombarded,
and according to the official despatch, the cannonade
“produced considerable effect in the Town and
among the Shipping.” The Earl of St Vincent now
proved how strict a disciplinarian he was. The crews
of some of the ships had shown unmistakable signs of
mutiny, and the Court Martial having passed sentence
on four of the ringleaders, the Commander-in-Chief
saw no reason for delaying the execution of the sentence.
He had the men hanged on a Sunday, a few hours
after they had been found guilty. Nelson strongly
approved of the execution, “even although it is <em>Sunday</em>.
The particular situation of the service requires extraordinary
measures.” It is significant that no signs
of dissatisfaction made themselves felt in any of the
Rear-Admiral’s ships, but Nelson’s words show that
he would not have condoned anything of the kind.</p>

<p>An attack on Santa Cruz, where it was believed
that the <i>Principe d’Asturias</i>, a ship of considerable
value belonging to the Philippine Company, had taken
shelter, next fell to Nelson’s lot. He had already
hinted to the Admiral that the conquest of Teneriffe
was an object very dear to him, which he was confident
“could not fail of success, would immortalize the
undertakers, ruin Spain, and has every prospect of
raising our Country to a higher pitch of wealth than
she has ever yet attained....” His plan was to
utilise the 3700 soldiers from Elba; “I will undertake
with a very small Squadron to do the Naval part.”
The scheme fell through, to be revived by the Earl
himself, but it was to be carried out without the assistance
of the troops. Three sail-of-the-line and the
same number of frigates were placed at Nelson’s disposal.
Ladders, sledge-hammers, wedges, axes, additional
iron ram-rods, and a sleigh for dragging cannon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
formed a necessary part of the equipment. A perusal
of the regulations recommended by the Rear-Admiral
shows that he took the most elaborate precautions to
ensure success. Captain Thomas Troubridge, of the
<i>Culloden</i>, was given command of the entire force,
Captain Oldfield directing the Marines, Lieutenant
Baynes his detachment of the Royal Artillery. The
first attempt was made on the night of the 21st and
failed, largely owing to adverse weather. As a consequence
the spot which Nelson had indicated as most
suitable for landing was not reached, and dawn disclosed
the whereabouts of the little expedition to the Spaniards.
It was also found impossible to get the battle-ships
close enough to the fort to create a diversion by bombardment
while the storming party attempted to gain
the heights.</p>

<p>Any blame which may have been attributable to
Troubridge was minimised by Nelson in his despatch
to the Admiral, “all has hitherto been done which was
possible, without effect.” He therefore decided to
command in person, “and to-morrow my head will
probably be crowned with either laurel or cypress.”
Did some premonition of disaster lead him to write
to the Earl of St Vincent to recommend his step-son
“to you and my Country,” and to add that “should
I fall in the service of my King and Country” the Duke
of Clarence would “take a lively interest” in Josiah
Nisbet? It was certainly not his way of saying things
at this stage of his career, although we know that in
1805 he avowed that Trafalgar would be his last battle.</p>

<p class="notbold">R. Caton Woodville</p></div></div>

<p>On the 24th Nelson was able to get his ships nearer
land than on the previous occasion. He and nearly
a thousand men set out in small boats at about eleven
o’clock at night for the Mole, where they were to disembark.
The oars being muffled and dead silence enjoined,
the enemy did not discover their approach till they were
within half gun-shot of the appointed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rendez-vous</i>.
Immediately thirty or forty cannon blazed out, the
sharp ping of musket shots rent the air, but, says Nelson,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
“nothing could stop the intrepidity of the Captains
leading the divisions. Unfortunately, the greatest
part of the Boats did not see the Mole, but went on
shore through a raging surf, which stove all the Boats
to the left of it.”</p>

<p>With the companies of four or five boats and two
Captains, the Rear-Admiral stormed the landing-place
in the darkness and took possession of it in the presence
of several hundred of the enemy. They then proceeded
to spike the guns, but were driven back by the heavy
fire which seemed to issue from every available point.
Scarcely a man escaped death or a wound. Nelson was
shot through the right elbow as he was stepping from
the boat. With rare presence of mind he quietly transferred
the sword he carried to his left hand. This
weapon, once the property of his uncle Maurice Suckling,
was treasured by him almost more than any other
possession. He was not going to leave that of all
things on Spanish soil! Young Nisbet happened to
be near his step-father at the moment he received his
wound, and placed him in the bottom of the boat.
He then held the arm so as to staunch the blood, untied
the silk handkerchief round his neck and bound
up the injury as best he could. After passing under
the enemy’s batteries the few men who had regained
the little craft bent to the oars and eventually pulled
out of range of the guns, but not before some of the
crew of the <i>Fox</i>, who had been flung into the sea owing to
the sinking of that cutter, had been rescued by them.
Someone suggested that Nelson should be taken to the
nearest vessel for surgical treatment. He would not
hear of this because the captain’s wife happened to be
on board and he had no intelligence of her husband’s
fate. Whatever agonies Nelson suffered, as the sadly
denuded crew made their way to the <i>Theseus</i>, were kept
to himself; scarcely a groan escaped his lips.</p>

<p>“At two o’clock [<span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>],” says a midshipman who
saw the sorrowful boatload, “Admiral Nelson returned
on board, being dreadfully wounded in the right arm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
with a grape-shot. I leave you to judge of my situation,
when I beheld our boat approach with him who
I may say has been a second father to me, his right
arm dangling by his side, whilst with the other he
helped himself to jump up the Ship’s side, and with
a spirit that astonished every one, told the surgeon to
get his instruments ready, for he knew he must lose
his arm, and that the sooner it was off the better. He
underwent the amputation with the same firmness
and courage that have always marked his character.”</p>

<p>Captain Troubridge and his men landed near the
citadel after most of the ammunition had been soaked
by the surf, which was so violent that it filled the boats
and stove them against the treacherous rocks. With
a handful of heroes he proceeded to the Square, previously
appointed as the meeting-place of the various
parties before the final attack. The scaling ladders
having been lost, and no further men making their
appearance after an hour’s wait, he set out to meet
Captains Hood and Miller, whom he believed had
effected a landing elsewhere. “By day-break,” runs
his official report to Nelson, “we had collected about
eighty Marines, eighty Pike-men, and one hundred
and eighty small-arm Seamen. These, I found, were
all that were alive that had made good their landing.
With this force, having procured some ammunition
from the Spanish prisoners we had made, we were
marching to try what could be done with the Citadel
without ladders; but found the whole of the streets
commanded by field-pieces, and upwards of eight
thousand Spaniards and one hundred French under
arms, approaching by every avenue. As the boats were
all stove, and I saw no possibility of getting more men
on shore&mdash;the ammunition wet, and no provisions&mdash;I
sent Captain Hood with a Flag of Truce to the Governor,
to say I was prepared to burn the Town, which I should
immediately put in force if he approached one inch
further; and, at the same time, I desired Captain
Hood to say it would be done with regret, as I had no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
wish to injure the inhabitants; that if he would come
to my terms, I was ready to treat, which he readily
agreed to....”</p>

<p>The terms were, “That the Troops, etc., belonging
to his Britannic Majesty shall embark with all their
arms of every kind, and take their Boats off, if saved,
and be provided with such other as may be wanting;
in consideration of which it is engaged on their part
they shall not molest the Town in any manner by the
Ships of the British Squadron now before it, or any of
the Islands in the Canaries; and prisoners shall be
given up on both sides.”</p>

<p>Troubridge’s game of bluff succeeded. His Excellency
Don Antonio Gutierrez, Commandant-General of the
Canary Islands, rid himself of the invaders and was
rewarded by Nelson with a cask of English beer and a

<p>It says much for Nelson’s indomitable pluck and
recuperative powers, as well as for his keen interest in
the service, that he allowed only two days to intervene
before he penned a letter with his left hand to the
Admiral. That he was depressed is obvious, that
he still had a fund of grim humour is equally evident
by the quaint postscript. The communication runs
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<i>Theseus, July 27th, 1797.</i>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="in4x">“I am become a burthen to my friends, and
useless to my Country; but by my letter wrote the

Cruz.</p>

<p>“I hope you will be able to give me a frigate, to
convey the remains of my carcase to England. God
bless you, my dear Sir, and believe me, your most
obliged and faithful,</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson</span>.
</p>

<p>“You will excuse my scrawl, considering it is my
first attempt.</p>

<p>“Sir John Jervis, K.Bth.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In another despatch to his senior officer the leader
of the ill-fated expedition avers that “A left-handed
Admiral will never again be considered as useful, therefore
the sooner I get to a very humble cottage the
better, and make room for a better man to serve the
State.” The noble Earl’s reply must have been as
healing balm to the wounded body and depressed
spirit of the man whose brilliant success had been
followed so quickly by disastrous failure. “Mortals
cannot command success;” he begins, “you and your
Companions have certainly deserved it, by the greatest
degree of heroism and perseverance that ever was
exhibited.” Such praise from St Vincent was praise
indeed, and he whimsically concludes by saying that
he will “bow to your stump to-morrow morning, if you
will give me leave.”</p>

<p>On the 20th August 1797, Nelson struck his flag on
the <i>Theseus</i> and hoisted it on the <i>Seahorse</i>, in which
ship he made “a very miserable passage home.” He
arrived at Spithead on the 1st September and proceeded
to Bath. To his brother he reported that his
health “never was better, and my arm is in the fairest
way of soon healing.” He intended to journey to
London, perhaps pay a short visit to Norfolk “for a
few days, especially if a decent house is likely to be met
with near Norwich; but Wroxham very far indeed exceeds
my purse. Bath will be my home till next spring.”
On the other hand Lady Nelson wrote on the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
date that her husband suffered “a good deal of pain&mdash;the
arm is taken off very high, near the shoulder,”
and he only obtained rest by resorting to opium.</p>

<p>If he never minimised a victory in his communications
Nelson certainly did not remark unduly on his wounds.
In writing to the Duke of Clarence he merely referred
to “my accident,” and passed on to assure his royal
friend “that not a scrap of that ardour with which
I have hitherto served our King has been shot away.”
It is only right, however, to add that in communicating
with the Comptroller of the Navy he was perhaps a
little unjust to Troubridge in the matter of the initial
attempt on Santa Cruz: “Had I been with the first
party, I have reason to believe complete success would
have crowned our endeavours.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> My pride suffered;
and although I felt the second attack a forlorn hope,
yet the honour of our Country called for the attack,
and that I should command it. I never expected to
return, and am thankful.”</p>

<p>On the 27th September, Nelson was invested with
the Ensigns of the Order of the Bath by George III.
at St James’s Palace. In addition he was granted
a pension of £1000 a year, having been “engaged
against the Enemy upwards of one hundred and twenty
times.” He became a popular hero, but as he
himself said, “Success covers a multitude of blunders,
and the want of it hides the greatest gallantry
and good conduct.” Compared to the victory off
Cape St Vincent the Santa Cruz fiasco was of little
moment. Kind-hearted John Bull dismissed the latter
incident and thought only of the former.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> year 1797 had been a particularly trying
one for Nelson both as regards health and
reputation; the succeeding twelve months
were to test his powers of endurance and his skill even
more. The services of the one-eyed, one-armed little
man were not to be dispensed with, as he had suggested
in a moment of despondency. He neither
retired to “a very humble cottage,” although he had
purchased a small property known as Round Wood,
near Ipswich, nor made room for “a better man.”
Truth to tell, there was no better man, and for once
the Admiralty knew its business. Nelson hoisted his
flag as Rear-Admiral of the Blue on board the <i>Vanguard</i>
(74) at Spithead on the 29th March 1798, sailed for
Lisbon with a convoy on the 10th April, and joined
his old fleet off Cadiz on the last day of that month,
the times “big with events.” Within forty-eight
hours he was ordered by St Vincent to ascertain the
destination of an immense armament which was preparing
at Toulon and other ports in the Mediterranean.
For this important service a squadron of three sail-of-the-line,
including his own ship, three frigates and a
sloop were placed at his disposal. A small French
corvette was captured, and by closely examining each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
member of the crew it was ascertained that although
Bonaparte had appeared at the great French port it
was not believed he would embark. The most important
point of all, namely, the destination of the expedition,
was not revealed: “all is secret.”</p>

<p>While off Toulon, Nelson encountered one of the
worst gales he ever experienced. His own account
of the fight with this universal enemy lacks the picturesque
details given by Captain Berry, of the <i>Vanguard</i>,
and we shall therefore quote from Berry’s letter. Nelson
tells his wife that “it was the Almighty’s goodness, to
check my consummate vanity”; his more matter-of-fact
captain sees only a natural cause. Just before sunset
on Sunday, the 20th of May, it became evident that
the spell of fine weather, which had been enjoyed hitherto,
was over. The wind increased in violence so much
that it became necessary to furl all the sails with the
exception of a main storm-staysail. “At about two,”
says Berry, “the main-topmast went over the side,
with the top-sailyard full of men. I dreaded the
inquiry of who were killed and drowned; fortunately
only one man fell overboard, and one fell on the booms,
and was killed on the spot. At half-past two the
mizen-topmast went over the side; the foremast gave
an alarming crack, and at a quarter past three went
by the board with a most tremendous crash, and, what
was very extraordinary, it fell in two pieces across the
forecastle. Our situation was really alarming: the
wreck of the fore-topmast and foremast hanging over
the side, and beating against the Ship’s bottom; the
best bower-anchor was flung out of its place, and was
also thumping the bottom; the wreck of the main
topmast swinging violently against the main-rigging,
every roll endangering the loss of the mainmast, which
we expected to fall every moment: thus circumstanced,
we endeavoured, though with but little hopes
of success, to wear,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> having no head-sail, and knowing
we were driving on an Enemy’s shore. Fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
there was a small rag of the sprit-sail left, and by watching
a favourable moment, we got her on the other tack.
The bowsprit did not go, though it was sprung in three
different places. The Ship rolled and laboured dreadfully,
but did not make any water, more than we shipped
over all. We cut the anchor from the bows, and got
clear of the wreck, with the loss of a boat and top-sailyard,
etc., and were not apprehensive of our bottom
being damaged.... For want of masts we rolled
dreadfully. The storm did not abate till Tuesday
afternoon, which enabled the <i>Alexander</i> to take us in
tow. Our situation on Tuesday night was the most
alarming I ever experienced....” At one time
Nelson was of opinion that both ships would go down,
and wished the <i>Vanguard</i> to be cast off. Captain
Alexander Ball, with whom the Rear-Admiral had
struck up a slight acquaintance at St Omer on the
occasion of his visit to France in 1783, would not hear
of it, and brought the vessels safely to the shelter of
the islands of San Pietro. After being patched up the
three sail-of-the-line again proceeded on their way to
Toulon, minus the smaller craft which had parted
company long since, and eventually returned to St
Vincent’s fleet.</p>

<p>Fortune had played Nelson false. The Toulon fleet
had escaped on the 19th May. While the three English
battle-ships were riding out the gale it was making for
Genoa, Ajaccio, and Civita Vecchia to rally transports.
The destination of the expedition was Egypt; Malta
the first object of prey. Shortly after the signature
of the Treaty of Campo Formio on the 17th October
1797, which pacified the Continent for a time, Napoleon
had returned in triumph to Paris from his victorious
Italian Campaign. He was then appointed by the
French Directory Commander of the Army of England,
so called because the purpose for which it was brought
into being was the subjugation of that country. Napoleon
certainly devoted much of his time to the project, but
soon came to the conclusion that the plan was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
practicable at the moment. He dreamed of Oriental
conquest, of occupying Egypt and invading India:
“We may change the face of the world!” How could
the command of the Channel be secured when Admiral
Lord Bridport commanded a formidable fleet in those
waters and frequently appeared off Brest, when Admiral
Lord Duncan patrolled the North Sea, and the naval
highways of Spithead, the Downs, the Nore, St George’s
Channel, and the Bay of Biscay were strongly guarded
by British fleets or divisions? The Mediterranean seemed
the only vulnerable point, for the Earl of St Vincent’s
fleet was alone stationed within striking distance of
that great inland sea.</p>

<p>It is necessary at this point to briefly refer to the
naval strength of Great Britain as compared with that
of France. At the beginning of 1798 the Republic
possessed fifty-seven sail-of-the-line, forty-six frigates
and seventy-two smaller vessels, to which must be
added nine remnants of the Venetian navy and whatever
forces could be commanded from Spain and Holland.
Fourteen sail-of-the-line, seventeen frigates, and three
cutters were on the stocks in French shipyards. During
the same year England had no fewer than one hundred and
twenty line-of-battle ships and over five hundred smaller
vessels at her disposal. The recent mutiny at the Nore
had shown that there was some dissatisfaction in the
British naval service, but the ships were not undermanned
as in France, they were in finer condition, and
the victories off Cape St Vincent and Camperdown had
acted as a stimulant. If those before the mast
occasionally grumbled, nothing further was heard of
organised insubordination.</p>

<p>The Admiralty had now sent a reinforcement of
eight battle-ships and two fire-ships to the Admiral,
who was told “to lose no time in detaching from your
Fleet a Squadron, consisting of twelve Sail-of-the-line,
and a competent number of Frigates, under the command
of some discreet Flag-Officer, into the Mediterranean,
with instructions to him to proceed in quest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
of the said Armament;<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and on falling in with it, or any
other Force belonging to the Enemy, to take or destroy
it.” The officer was also “to remain upon this service
so long as the provisions of the said Squadron will last,
or as long as he may be enabled to obtain supplies
from any of the ports in the Mediterranean.” According
to later orders supplies were to be exacted “from
the territories of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, the King
of the Two Sicilies, the Ottoman Territory, Malta, and
ci-devant Venetian Dominions now belonging to the
Emperor of Germany.” The Dey of Algiers, the Bey
of Tunis, and the Bashaw of Tripoli were also believed
to be friendly. Lord Spencer, First Lord of the
Admiralty, suggested Nelson as the most likely man
for this extremely important service. Several eminent
personages claimed to have aided him in his selection,
including Sir Gilbert Elliot and the King.</p>

<p>Sir Horatio was accordingly given command of a
squadron which numbered thirteen line-of-battle ships,
all carrying seventy-four guns, and one fifty-gun ship,
the <i>Leander</i>. St Vincent’s selection awoke the ire of
Nelson’s two seniors in the Earl’s fleet, namely, Sir
William Parker and Sir John Orde. As we have seen,
the Admiral had scarcely a voice in the matter, and
subsequent events abundantly confirmed the wisdom of
the appointment. Unfortunately there were no frigates,
“the eyes of a fleet.” As to the destination of Napoleon
and his army of adventurers, the Rear-Admiral was
not far wrong when he wrote to Lord Spencer on the
15th June, after interrogating the captain of a Tunisian
cruiser who had seen them on the 4th off Trapani, that
“If they pass Sicily, I shall believe they are going on
their scheme of possessing Alexandria, and getting troops
to India&mdash;a plan concerted with Tippoo Saib, by no
means so difficult as might at first view be imagined;
but be they bound to the Antipodes, your Lordship
may rely that I will not lose a moment in bringing
them to Action, and endeavour to destroy their Transports.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Off Messina he heard that the French had
taken possession of Malta. After discussing the matter
with his captains he decided to sail for Alexandria, which
he reached two days before the enemy’s arrival. He
then “stretched the Fleet over to the Coast of Asia,”
and “passed close to the southern side of Candia, but
without seeing one Vessel in our route.” This was
the position on the 12th July, when he was still “without
the smallest information of the French Fleet since
their leaving Malta.” A week later the squadron
anchored in Syracuse harbour to obtain water and
provisions, set off again on the 25th, and on the 28th
the important news was obtained that about a month
before the French fleet had been seen sailing in the
direction of the south-east from Candia. To Nelson
this intelligence meant but one destination&mdash;Alexandria.
His surmise was correct: “I attacked at sunset on
the 1st of August, off the Mouth of the Nile.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is difficult for a landsman to appreciate the joy
with which Nelson’s captains, his “Band of
Brothers,” as he called them, as well as the men of
lower rank, beheld the enemy moored in line of battle
parallel with the shore in Aboukir Bay on what might
well be termed “the glorious first of August.” They
had been searching the Mediterranean for long, weary
weeks, anxious to try conclusions with Napoleon’s
fleet, but thwarted at every turn by lack of information.
At last they were face to face, led by an admiral of
unequalled resolution in whom they placed implicit
confidence.</p>

<p>“The utmost joy,” says Berry,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> “seemed to animate
every breast on board the Squadron, at sight of the
Enemy; and the pleasure which the Admiral himself
felt, was perhaps more heightened than that of any other
man, as he had now a certainty by which he could
regulate his future operations. The Admiral had, and it
appeared most justly, the highest opinion of, and placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the firmest reliance on, the valour and conduct of every
Captain in his Squadron. It had been his practice during
the whole of the cruize, whenever the weather and circumstances
would permit, to have his Captains on
board the <i>Vanguard</i>, where he would fully develop to
them his own ideas of the different and best modes of
attack, and such plans as he proposed to execute upon
falling in with the Enemy, whatever their position or
situation might be, by day or by night. There was no
possible position in which they could be found, that he
did not take into his calculation, and for the most
advantageous attack of which he had not digested and
arranged the best possible disposition of the force which
he commanded. With the masterly ideas of their
Admiral, therefore, on the subject of Naval tactics,
every one of the Captains of his Squadron was most
thoroughly acquainted; and upon surveying the situation
of the Enemy, they could ascertain with precision
what were the ideas and intentions of their Commander,
without the aid of any further instructions; by which
means signals became almost unnecessary, much time
was saved, and the attention of every Captain could
almost undistractedly be paid to the conduct of his own
particular Ship, a circumstance from which, upon this
occasion, the advantages to the general service were
almost incalculable.”</p>

<p>We must now try to understand the strength and
position of the French fleet. It consisted of thirteen line-of-battle
ships, three carrying eighty guns and one one
hundred and twenty guns, and four frigates. Napoleon,
who was far away adding triumph to triumph, had left
Admiral Brueys with three alternative plans. He could
enter the port of Alexandria, Aboukir Roads, or sail for
Corfu, leaving the transports at Alexandria. Brueys
soon found that the harbour scarcely held sufficient water
for the navigation of his largest ships. Once inside, it
would be next to impossible to get them out in front of
a hostile fleet on account of the narrow exit. He chose
Aboukir Bay, in a position some ten miles from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Rosetta mouth of the Nile. Here he anchored his
thirteen battle-ships, with great gaps between them, in
a line roughly parallel with the shore, and flanked by
gunboats and frigates. His van was placed as close to
Aboukir Island as was practicable. Dr Fitchett has
rather overstated the case in saying that “a battery of
mortars on the island guarded, as with a sword of fire,
the gap betwixt the headmost ship and the island.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
In another place he also refers to the head of the French
line being “protected by a powerful shore battery.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
There were certainly a few guns, but “a sword of fire”
suggests a heavy armament, and Napoleon had occasion
later to severely criticise the Admiral’s arrangement in
this matter.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Brueys was ill, his marines had almost
got out of hand, many of the sailors were raw recruits,
and subversive of discipline, and some of the vessels were
scarcely seaworthy. In tonnage and guns the French
had the advantage, in <em>morale</em> and fighting capacity, the
British were first.</p>

<p>Nelson determined to sail between Brueys’ line and
the shallows. Five British ships, led by the <i>Goliath</i>,
crossed the bows of the first ship of the French van,
inshore of the enemy’s line, and anchored abreast of one
of the Frenchmen, while three more, including Nelson’s
<i>Vanguard</i>, stationed themselves on the outer side.
Some of the captains for various reasons were unable to
take up their correct fighting positions, the <i>Culloden</i>,
for instance, struck a shoal and took no part in the
battle. The enemy’s van was surrounded and conquered;
the centre became engaged; the rear alone
escaped, Villeneuve, its commander, making off with two
battleships and two frigates without attempting to fight.</p>

<p>“The actions,” Captain Berry relates, “commenced
at sunset, which was at thirty-one minutes past six, p.m.,
with an ardour and vigour which it is impossible to
describe. At about seven o’clock total darkness had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
come on, but the whole hemisphere was, with intervals,
illuminated by the fire of the hostile Fleets. Our Ships,
when darkness came on, had all hoisted their distinguishing
lights, by a signal from the Admiral. The Van ship
of the Enemy, <i>Le Guerrier</i>, was dismasted in less than
twelve minutes, and, in ten minutes after, the second
ship, <i>Le Conquérant</i>, and the third, <i>Le Spartiate</i>, very
nearly at the same moment were almost dismasted.
<i>L’Aquilon</i> and <i>Le Peuple Souverain</i>, the fourth and fifth
Ships of the Enemy’s line, were taken possession of by the
British at half-past eight in the evening. Captain
Berry, at that hour, sent Lieutenant Galwey, of the
<i>Vanguard</i>, with a party of marines, to take possession of
<i>Le Spartiate</i>, and that officer returned by the boat, the
French Captain’s sword, which Captain Berry immediately
delivered to the Admiral, who was then below,
in consequence of the severe wound which he had
received in the head during the heat of the attack. At
this time it appeared that victory had already declared
itself in our favour, for, although <i>L’Orient</i>, <i>L’Heureux</i>,
and <i>Tonnant</i> were not taken possession of, they were
considered as completely in our power, which pleasing
intelligence Captain Berry had likewise the satisfaction
of communicating in person to the Admiral. At ten
minutes after ten, a fire was observed on board <i>L’Orient</i>,
the French Admiral’s Ship, which seemed to proceed
from the after part of the cabin, and which increased
with great rapidity, presently involving the whole of the
after part of the Ship in flames. This circumstance
Captain Berry immediately communicated to the
Admiral, who, though suffering severely from his wound,
came up upon deck, where the first consideration that
struck his mind was concern for the danger of so many
lives, to save as many as possible of whom he ordered
Captain Berry to make every practicable exertion. A
boat, the only one that could swim, was instantly
dispatched from the <i>Vanguard</i>, and other Ships that
were in a condition to do so, immediately followed the
example; by which means, from the best possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
information, the lives of about seventy Frenchmen were
saved.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> The light thrown by the fire of <i>L’Orient</i> upon
the surrounding objects, enabled us to perceive with more
certainty the situation of the two Fleets, the colours of
both being clearly distinguishable. The cannonading
was partially kept up to leeward of the Centre till about
ten o’clock, when <i>L’Orient</i> blew up with a most tremendous
explosion. An awful pause and death-like
silence for about three minutes ensued, when the wreck
of the masts, yards, etc., which had been carried to a vast
height, fell down into the water, and on board the surrounding
Ships. A port fire from <i>L’Orient</i> fell into the
main royal of the <i>Alexander</i>, the fire occasioned by which
was, however, extinguished in about two minutes, by
the active exertions of Captain Ball.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“The flame that lit the battle’s wreck”</p>

<p class="notbold">Charles Dixon, R.I., from a sketch by C.&nbsp;W. Cole</p></div></div>

<p>“After this awful scene, the firing was recommenced
with the Ships to leeward of the Centre, till twenty
minutes past ten, when there was a total cessation of
firing for about ten minutes; after which it was revived
till about three in the morning, when it again ceased.
After the victory had been secured in the Van, such
British ships as were in a condition to move, had gone
down upon the fresh Ships of the Enemy, which occasioned
these renewals of the fight, all of which terminated with
the same happy success in favour of our Flag. At five
minutes past five in the morning, the two Rear ships of
the Enemy, <i>Le Guillaume Tell</i> and <i>Le Généreux</i>, were the
only French ships of the Line that had their colours
flying. At fifty-four minutes past five, a French frigate,
<i>L’Artemise</i>, fired a broadside and struck her colours;
but such was the unwarrantable and infamous conduct
of the French Captain, that after having thus surrendered,
he set fire to his Ship, and with part of his
crew, made his escape on shore. Another of the French
frigates, <i>La Sérieuse</i>, had been sunk by the fire from some
of our Ships; but as her poop remained above water,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
her men were saved upon it, and were taken off by our
boats in the morning. The <i>Bellerophon</i>, whose masts
and cables had been entirely shot away, could not retain
her situation abreast of <i>L’Orient</i>, but had drifted out
of the line to the lee side of the Bay, a little before that
Ship blew up. The <i>Audacious</i> was in the morning
detached to her assistance. At eleven o’clock, <i>Le
Généreux</i> and <i>Guillaume Tell</i>, with the two frigates,
<i>La Justice</i> and <i>La Diane</i>, cut their cables and stood out to
sea, pursued by the <i>Zealous</i>, Captain Hood, who, as the
Admiral himself has stated, handsomely endeavoured
to prevent their escape; but as there was no other Ship
in a condition to support the <i>Zealous</i>, she was recalled.
The whole day of the 2nd was employed in securing the
French ships that had struck, and which were now all
completely in our possession, <i>Le Tonnant</i> and <i>Timoleon</i>
excepted; as these were both dismasted, and consequently
could not escape, they were naturally the last
of which we thought of taking possession. On the
morning of the third, the <i>Timoleon</i> was set fire to, and
<i>Le Tonnant</i> had cut her cable and drifted on shore, but
that active officer, Captain Miller, of the <i>Theseus</i>, soon
got her off again, and secured her in the British line.”</p>

<p>It was a decisive victory, the only kind of victory that
appealed to Nelson, who styled it a “conquest.” Of the
thirteen French battleships, nine were taken, one was
blown up, one was burnt, and two escaped; one frigate
sank, another was destroyed by fire, and two got away.
Napoleon had been deprived of his only means of communication
with France. Thus the sea swallowed his
triumphs. From a political point of view the battle
of the Nile paved the way for the formation of the Second
Coalition against France, in which six Powers took
part, namely, England, Russia, Austria, Turkey, Naples,
and Portugal.</p>

<p>Nelson received his wound by being struck in the
forehead by a piece of iron. The skin was torn so badly
that it hung over his face, the blood streaming down
with such profusion that he was afraid his left eye had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
gone like the right. “I am killed”; he cried to
Captain Berry, “remember me to my wife.” But the
Admiral had been “killed” in battle before, and the
intense pain of the wound sufficiently justified the
exclamation. He was carried to the cockpit, the cut
bound up, and strict quiet enjoined. This was easier said
than done with a patient such as Nelson. His abnormal
mentality speedily gained ascendancy over his physical
infirmities. He soon declared that he felt better, and
shortly afterwards had so far recovered as to begin a
dictated despatch to the Admiralty. On the Captain
informing him that <i>L’Orient</i> was ablaze he insisted on
clambering to the deck, as we have seen. Berry gave
him his arm, and together they witnessed the disaster.
Nelson was certainly more fortunate than Brueys, who
was shot almost in two.</p>

<p>On the 2nd August the Admiral returned Public
Thanksgiving on the <i>Vanguard</i>, an example he desired
to be followed on every ship “as soon as convenient.”
He also took the opportunity to thank the men of the
squadron for the part they had played in the late
action: “It must strike forcibly every British Seaman,
how superior their conduct is, when in discipline and good
order, to the riotous behaviour of lawless Frenchmen.”</p>

<p>In those days precedent was a fetish. To depart from
what had previously obtained was not to be thought of,
much less suggested. For this reason Nelson was
created a Baron, the lowest rank in the peerage, but the
highest that had been conferred “on an officer of your
standing,” as he was informed. In addition he was
voted a pension of £2000 a year, which was also to be
paid to his two next heirs.</p>

<p>Mention of the “great and brilliant Victory” was
made in the King’s Speech at the opening of Parliament,
its organiser received the thanks of both Houses, as
well as of the Parliament of Ireland, and many foreign
potentates and British Corporations paid him honour.
Among the numerous presents he received were two
boxes set with diamonds, a superb diamond aigrette,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
a gold-headed cane, pieces of valuable plate, and a
coffin. The latter, made of wood and iron from the ill-fated
<i>L’Orient</i>, was sent to him by Captain Hallowell.
By a strange coincidence Thanksgiving services were held
in the churches of the United Kingdom on the 21st
October, a date ever associated with Nelson, because of
Trafalgar. It may be thought that there was unnecessary
delay, but it must be remembered that the
wonders of telegraphy were then undreamed of. News
of the victory was not received in London until the
fifty-seventh day after the event. “God be praised,”
writes the Earl of St Vincent, “and you and your gallant
band rewarded by a grateful Country, for the greatest
Achievement the history of the world can produce.”
Perhaps this noble sentiment from the Commander-in-chief
was valued above the insignificant rewards of the
Government.</p>

<p>To “Fighting” Berry Nelson entrusted the charge
of his despatches for the Admiral, for which purpose he
was given the <i>Leander</i> (50). With grim irony Fate
played a trick entirely unworthy so gallant an officer.
On the 18th August, off Gozo, near Candia, the
<i>Généreux</i>, which it will be remembered escaped from
Nelson’s vengeance at the Nile, appeared on the horizon.
The frigate attempted to show “a clean pair of heels,”
but recognising that the enemy was gaining in the race,
sail was shortened and the decks cleared for action.
The brave defenders of the <i>Leander</i> resisted manfully
for over six hours until the mastless, rudderless hulk
could be fought no longer. Berry, who was wounded,
together with the officers and crew were landed at Corfu
and thence sent to Trieste, where the officers were
released on <em>parole</em>, and the crew kept prisoners. On
being exchanged, the captain received the honour of
knighthood, a reward richly deserved and valiantly
won. Berry got even with the French after all, for in
1799 he turned the tables on the victors by capturing
the <i>Généreux</i> with Nelson’s flagship, the <i>Foudroyant</i>.</p>

<p>Captain Sir James Saumarez, with twelve ships of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
squadron, was directed to convoy the best of the prizes
to Gibraltar, the remainder, being valueless, were set
on fire. Hood was called upon to blockade Alexandria,
and two of the battleships were sent to Naples for very
necessary repairs. To this port the <i>Vanguard</i> laboriously
followed. Nelson was “taken with a fever, which has
very near done my business: for eighteen hours, my life
was thought to be past hope; I am now up, but very
weak both in body and mind, from my cough and this
fever.” This was on the 20th September, two days
before “the wreck of <i>Vanguard</i> arrived in the Bay of
Naples.” The occasion was one of great rejoicing on the
part of the Sicilian Court. Miss Knight, the daughter
of Rear-Admiral Sir Joseph Knight, who was present,
thus records the events of the 22nd inst.:</p>

<p>“In the evening, went out with Sir William and Lady
Hamilton, music, &amp;c., to meet Admiral Nelson, who in
the <i>Vanguard</i>, with the <i>Thalia</i> Frigate (Captain Newhouse)
was seen coming in. We went on board, about
a league out at sea, and sailed in with him: soon after
us, the King came on board, and staid till the anchor
was dropped. He embraced the Admiral with the
greatest warmth, and said he wished he could have been
in the engagement,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> and served under his orders; and
that he likewise wished he could have been in England,
when the news of the victory arrived there. He went
down to see the Ship, and was delighted to perceive the
care taken of a wounded man, who had two to serve
him, and one reading to him. He asked to see the hat
which saved the Admiral’s life, when he was wounded
in the head with a splinter. The Queen was taken with
a fit of the ague when she was coming on board with the
Princesses. Commodore Caraccioli came soon after the
King, and many of the Neapolitan nobility, bands of
music, &amp;c. It happened to be the anniversary of our
King’s coronation. The Admiral came on shore with
us, and said, it was the first time he had been out of his
Ship for six months, except once on board Lord St<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Vincent.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The Russian Ambassador and all the Legation
came out to meet him. When we landed at the Health
Office, the applauses and the crowd of people were beyond
description. Admiral Nelson is little, and not remarkable
in his person either way; but he has great animation
of countenance, and activity in his appearance:
his manners are unaffectedly simple and modest. He
lodges at Sir William Hamilton’s, who has given him
the upper apartment. The whole City is mad with joy.”</p>

<p>There was indeed every reason for this jubilation.
A starless night seemed about to give place to a golden
dawn. Towards the end of 1796 Napoleon’s astounding
successes had obliged Ferdinand, King of the Two
Sicilies, to agree to terms of peace, especially as the
English had decided to evacuate the Mediterranean.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
The situation became more and more ominous. Consequently
when Queen Maria Carolina, Ferdinand’s
energetic consort, heard that the King of Spain was
about to ally himself to the hated Republic, she
speedily informed Sir William Hamilton, the English
Ambassador.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> She realised that the hope of the
kingdom depended not in half-measures of friendship
towards England, but in securing her definite assistance
and casting off the French yoke. Hamilton in his
turn warned his Government of the proposed arrangement,
which seemed likely to have far-reaching consequences
and to threaten England in the Mediterranean.
Her Majesty also kept up a secret correspondence with
London. She was therefore particularly relieved when
information arrived that the protection of the Two
Sicilies against potential French despoilers was to be
entrusted to the Hero of the Nile.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Truth</span> has no secrets. It is the duty of the
historian to reveal all and to hide nothing.
The archæologist with pick and spade unearths
a buried city, disclosing alike the mansions of the wealthy
and the hovels of the poor. In describing the result of
his researches the investigator would betray his science
were he merely to mention the beauties of the king’s
palace, the tesselated pavements, the marble columns.
The hideous back street must also tell its drab story,
for aristocrat and plebeian are alike members of the
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The pen is the scalpel of history. It must neither
condone nor palliate, although justice may be tempered
with mercy.</p>

<p>Temptation came to Nelson at Naples, and he fell.
Physically frail, he proved morally frail as well, but we
must not unhesitatingly condemn him. Vanity caused
him to stumble, and before he had time to realise the
consequences a woman had sullied his reputation and
tarnished his glory. Probably no reputable biographer
of the great Admiral has penned the chapter dealing with
this phase of his life without a wish that he could be
excused from the necessity of doing so.</p>

<p>No sooner do we begin to investigate the relations
between Nelson and Lady Hamilton than we are in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
maze of perplexities. He was ill and she nursed him,
he was victorious and she praised him, she was beautiful
and he admired loveliness, she had a warm heart
and he was susceptible, his wife was reserved and his
“friend” was vivacious. The spider and the fly have
their counterpart in real life. Once in the entangled
meshes of the web Nelson never found his way out,
even supposing he had wished to do so, which his passionate
letters do not for a moment suggest.</p>

<p>When the <i>Vanguard</i> hove in sight off Naples, King
Ferdinand, Sir William Hamilton, Lady Hamilton, and
others went to meet “our liberator.” In writing to
Earl Spencer, Nelson says, “You will not, my Lord, I
trust, think that one spark of vanity induces me to
mention the most distinguished reception that ever, I
believe, fell to the lot of a human being, but that it is
a measure of justice due to his Sicilian Majesty and the
Nation. If God knows my heart, it is amongst the most
humble of the creation, full of thankfulness and gratitude!”
No one doubts the latter portion of the remark.
Nelson always exhibited a lively trust in an All-wise
Providence. The “one spark of vanity” was self-deception,
although perhaps “pride” would be more
correct than “vanity,” for the vain man usually distrusts
his own opinion in setting great store by himself
and wishes it to be confirmed by others. The Admiral
was nothing if not self-reliant. Those who have read
his voluminous correspondence and the memoirs of those
with whom he came in contact cannot be blind to the
fault of which he was seemingly in ignorance.</p>

<p>For instance, the writer of the “Croker Papers”
furnishes us with the following particulars of the one and
only occasion on which Nelson and Wellington had conversation.
The latter noted the Admiral’s weak point
at once:</p>

<p>“We were talking of Lord Nelson, and some instances
were mentioned of the egotism and vanity that derogated
from his character. ‘Why,’ said the Duke, ‘I
am not surprised at such instances, for Lord Nelson was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
in different circumstances, two quite different men, as I
myself can vouch, though I only saw him once in my life,
and for, perhaps, an hour. It was soon after I returned
from India.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> I went to the Colonial Office in Downing
Street, and there I was shown into the little waiting-room
on the right hand, where I found, also waiting to
see the Secretary of State, a gentleman, whom from
his likeness to his pictures and the loss of an arm, I
immediately recognised as Lord Nelson. He could not
know who I was, but he entered at once into conversation
with me, if I can call it conversation, for it was almost
all on his side and all about himself, and in, really, a
style so vain and so silly as to surprise and almost
disgust me. I suppose something that I happened to
say may have made him guess that I was <em>somebody</em>,
and he went out of the room for a moment, I have no
doubt to ask the office-keeper who I was, for when he
came back he was altogether a different man, both in
manner and matter. All that I had thought a charlatan
style had vanished, and he talked of the state of this
country and of the aspect and probabilities of affairs
on the Continent with a good sense, and a knowledge
of subjects both at home and abroad, that surprised me
equally and more agreeably than the first part of our
interview had done; in fact, he talked like an officer
and a statesman. The Secretary of State kept us long
waiting, and certainly, for the last half or three-quarters
of an hour, I don’t know that I ever had a conversation
that interested me more. Now, if the Secretary of State
had been punctual, and admitted Lord Nelson in the
first quarter of an hour, I should have had the same
impression of a light and trivial character that other
people have had, but luckily I saw enough to be satisfied
that he was really a very superior man; but
certainly a more sudden and complete metamorphosis
I never saw.’”</p>

<p>To sum up the whole matter. Pride, or vanity if
you prefer it, laid Nelson open to the great temptation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
of his life, and it assailed him at a time when he was
ill and suffering. He was by nature sympathetic and
grateful, and could not fail to be impressed by the
ministrations of Lady Hamilton during his sickness, any
less than by her flattery&mdash;a hero-worship which may, or
may not, have been sincere on her part.</p>

<p>Josceline Percy, who was on the <i>Victory</i> in the trying
times of 1803, has some sage remarks to offer in this
matter. Though the Christian faith “did not keep
him from the fatal error of his life,” Percy says, “it
ought to be remembered that few were so strongly
tempted, and I believe it may safely be affirmed that
had Nelson’s home been made to him, what a wife of
good temper and judgment would have rendered it,
never would he have forsaken it.”</p>

<p>The candid friend, though seldom loved, is oftentimes
the best friend. Nelson was warned of his mad infatuation
for Lady Hamilton by more than one person who
desired to save him from himself, but the fatal spell
which she exerted upon him held him beyond reclamation.</p>

<p>On meeting the Admiral Lady Hamilton fainted
away, and we find the hero writing to his wife that
“she is one of the very best women in this world;
she is an honour to her sex. Her kindness, with Sir
William’s, to me, is more than I can express: I am in
their house, and I may now tell you, it required all the
kindness of my friends to set me up.” A week or so
later, he says, “The continued kind attention of Sir
William and Lady Hamilton must ever make you and I
love them, and they are deserving the love and admiration
of all the world.”</p>

<p>We must now return to the scene of the tragedy.
Italy was in a turmoil. Berthier had appeared before
Rome, the aged Pontiff had been dragged from his
palace and sent into Tuscany, a Republic set up, and an
offensive and defensive alliance entered into with Revolutionary
France. By his placing the citadel of Turin
in the hands of the all-conquering nation for “security”
the King of Sardinia became a mere State-prisoner.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
These events in the North naturally caused trepidation
in the kingdom of Naples, and Ferdinand wisely secured
the assistance of Austria. The news of the French
defeat at the Nile, more especially the presence of the
victor, caused the war party&mdash;of which Queen Maria
Carolina and Lady Hamilton were the leaders&mdash;to forget
that mere enthusiasm, although a valuable asset, was not
the sole requisite in a campaign, especially when the
enemy to be met was one so formidable as the victorious
French. Naples was for up and doing, regardless of the
consequences. She sowed the storm and reaped the
whirlwind by reason of her undue haste in taking up
arms before everything was ready for the conflict. There
is perhaps some excuse for her Majesty’s eagerness.
Sister of the ill-fated Marie Antoinette, who had perished
on the scaffold, and “truly a daughter of Maria Theresa,”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
as Nelson averred, she wished to be avenged. Lady
Hamilton on her part had become the confidential
friend of Her Majesty and had rendered certain services
to the Neapolitan and English Courts which she afterwards
grossly exaggerated in an endeavour to secure a
competence for herself. Nelson is not undeserving of
censure for having forced the issue. He quoted
Chatham’s dictum, “The boldest measures are the
safest,” to Lady Hamilton, and told her that should
“this miserable ruinous system of procrastination be
persisted in, I would recommend that all your property
and persons are ready to embark at a very short notice.”</p>

<p>Nelson’s instructions were to provide for the safety
of the Sicilian kingdom, “the cutting off all communication
between France and Egypt,” and “the co-operating
with the Turkish and Russian Squadrons which are to
be sent into the Archipelago.” In addition he was to
blockade Malta. He delegated the last duty to Captain
Ball, who, with four ships, was to cruise off the island<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
in company with a Portuguese squadron under the
Marquis de Niza. Of General Mack, who commanded the
Neapolitan army, Nelson at first entertained a favourable
opinion. With delightful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïveté</i> he informed St
Vincent, “I have endeavoured to impress the General
with a favourable impression of me, and I think have
succeeded. He is active and has an intelligent eye,
and will do well, I have no doubt.” But something more
than these estimable qualities was necessary, as the
total failure of the campaign was to prove.</p>

<p>Mack was then forty-six years of age, and had served
under Field-Marshal Loudon, the most formidable
soldier against whom Frederick the Great had fought.
He was not a brilliant soldier, although he had acquitted
himself with honour in the campaign of 1793. The
son of a minor official, Mack had found it difficult to
obtain promotion in a service dominated by the aristocracy,
and he was certainly unpopular, which was not
to his advantage in the field. He had accepted his
present service in an army which he called “the finest
in Europe,” but which was scarcely more than a rabble,
at the request of the Empress. Nelson, in a burst of
enthusiasm, referred to it as “composed of 30,000
healthy good-looking troops,” and “as far as my
judgment goes in those matters, I agree, that a finer
Army cannot be.” The optimistic told themselves that
Nelson had banished Napoleon and the finest warriors
of France, which was correct, and prophesied that the
scattered Republican army in Italy would be as completely
overwhelmed as was the French fleet in Aboukir
Bay. In this they were grievously mistaken. Instead of
concentrating his forces and striking a decisive blow, the
Austrian commander saw fit to divide them, with the
result that although the Eternal City was occupied
and Tuscany entered, the French succeeded in defeating
three of the five columns. After a series of reverses,
Mack retreated, Ferdinand fled, and Rome was retaken.</p>

<p>Nelson’s part in this unfortunate undertaking was
to convey some 5,000 troops to Leghorn and effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
a diversion in the rear of the enemy by taking possession
of the aforementioned port. When this was done,
and the cannon and baggage landed, Nelson returned
to Naples. The story of the campaign, which ended
in disaster and the creation of the Parthenopeian
Republic<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> at Naples, does not concern us. Suffice it
to say that in the last month of 1798 King Ferdinand
and his Court concluded that they would be safer under
Nelson’s protection than in the Capital. They therefore
embarked in the British fleet on the night of the
21st December, whence they were taken to Palermo.
The circumstances and manner of the enforced retreat
are described at length in the Admiral’s despatch to
the Earl of St Vincent, which runs as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“... For many days previous to the embarkation
it was not difficult to foresee that such a thing might
happen, I therefore sent for the <i>Goliath</i> from off Malta,
and for Captain Troubridge in the <i>Culloden</i>, and his
Squadron from the north and west Coast of Italy, the
<i>Vanguard</i> being the only Ship in Naples Bay. On the
14th, the Marquis de Niza, with three of the Portuguese
Squadron, arrived from Leghorn, as did Captain Hope
in the <i>Alcmene</i> from Egypt: from this time, the danger
for the personal safety of their Sicilian Majesties was
daily increasing, and new treasons were found out, even
to the Minister of War. The whole correspondence
relative to this important business was carried on with
the greatest address by Lady Hamilton and the Queen,
who being constantly in the habits of correspondence,
no one could suspect. It would have been highly
imprudent in either Sir William Hamilton or myself
to have gone to Court, as we knew that all our movements
were watched, and even an idea by the Jacobins
of arresting our persons as a hostage (as they foolishly
imagined) against the attack of Naples, should the
French get possession of it.</p>

<p>“Lady Hamilton, from this time to the 21st, every
night received the jewels of the Royal Family, &amp;c., &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
and such clothes as might be necessary for the very large
party to embark, to the amount, I am confident, of full
two millions five hundred thousand pounds sterling.
On the 18th, General Mack wrote that he had no prospect
of stopping the progress of the French, and entreated
their Majesties to think of retiring from Naples with
their august Family as expeditiously as possible. All
the Neapolitan Navy were now taken out of the Mole,
consisting of three Sail of the Line and three Frigates:
the seamen from the two Sail of the Line in the Bay
left their Ships and went on shore: a party of English
seamen with Officers were sent from the <i>Vanguard</i> to
assist in navigating them to a place of safety. From the
18th, various plans were formed for the removal of the
Royal Family from the palace to the water-side; on the
19th, I received a note from General Acton,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> saying,
that the King approved of my plan for their embarkation;
this day, the 20th and 21st, very large assemblies of
people were in commotion, and several people were
killed, and one dragged by the legs to the palace. The
mob by the 20th were very unruly, and insisted the
Royal Family should not leave Naples; however, they
were pacified by the King and Queen speaking to
them.</p>

<p>“On the 21st, at half-past 8 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, three Barges with
myself and Captain Hope, landed at a corner of the
Arsenal. I went into the palace and brought out the
whole Royal Family, put them into the Boats, and at
half-past nine they were all safely on board the <i>Vanguard</i>,
when I gave immediate notice to all British
Merchants that their persons would be received on board
every and any Ship in the Squadron, their effects of
value being before embarked in the three English transports
who were partly unloaded, and I had directed
that all the condemned provisions should be thrown
overboard, in order to make room for their effects.
Sir William Hamilton had also directed two Vessels
to be hired for the accommodation of the French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
emigrants,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and provisions were supplied from our
Victuallers; in short, everything had been done for
the comfort of all persons embarked.</p>

<p>“I did not forget in these important moments that
it was my duty not to leave the chance of any Ships
of War falling into the hands of the French, therefore,
every preparation was made for burning them before
I sailed; but the reasons given me by their Sicilian
Majesties, induced me not to burn them till the last
moment. I, therefore, directed the Marquis de Niza
to remove all the Neapolitan Ships outside the Squadron
under his command, and if it was possible, to equip some
of them with jury masts and send them to Messina;
and whenever the French advanced near Naples, or the
people revolted against their legitimate Government,
immediately to destroy the Ships of War, and to join
me at Palermo, leaving one or two Ships to cruize
between Capri and Ischia in order to prevent the entrance
of any English Ship into the Bay of Naples. On the
23rd, at 7 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, the <i>Vanguard</i>, <i>Sannite</i>, and <i>Archimedes</i>,
with about twenty sail of Vessels left the Bay of Naples;
the next day it blew harder than I ever experienced
since I have been at sea. Your Lordship will believe
that my anxiety was not lessened by the great charge
that was with me, but not a word of uneasiness escaped
the lips of any of the Royal Family. On the 25th, at
9 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, Prince Albert, their Majesties’ youngest child,
having eat a hearty breakfast, was taken ill, and at
7 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> died in the arms of Lady Hamilton; and here it is
my duty to tell your Lordship the obligations which
the whole Royal Family as well as myself are under on
this trying occasion to her Ladyship.... Lady Hamilton
provided her own beds, linen, &amp;c., and became <em>their
slave</em>, for except one man, no person belonging to Royalty
assisted the Royal Family, nor did her Ladyship enter a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
bed the whole time they were on board. Good Sir
William also made every sacrifice for the comfort of the
august Family embarked with him. I must not omit
to state the kindness of Captain Hardy and every Officer
in the <i>Vanguard</i>, all of whom readily gave their beds for
the convenience of the numerous persons attending the
Royal Family.</p>

<p>“At 3 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, being in sight of Palermo, his Sicilian
Majesty’s Royal Standard was hoisted at the main-top
gallant-mast head of the <i>Vanguard</i>, which was kept
flying there till his Majesty got into the <i>Vanguard’s</i>
barge, when it was struck in the Ship and hoisted in the
Barge, and every proper honour paid to it from the Ship.
As soon as his Majesty set his foot on shore, it was struck
from the Barge. The <i>Vanguard</i> anchored at 2 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>
of the 26th; at 5, I attended her Majesty and all the
Princesses on shore; her Majesty being so much affected
by the death of Prince Albert that she could not bear
to go on shore in a public manner. At 9 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, his
Majesty went on shore, and was received with the loudest
acclamations and apparent joy.”</p>

<p>Alas, that one has to admit that while Lady Hamilton
was the “slave” of the Sicilian Royal Family, Nelson
was rapidly becoming so infatuated that the same word
might be used to describe his relationship with “our
dear invaluable Lady Hamilton”! He also seems to
have had an exaggerated sense of the importance of the
princely personages who had placed themselves under his
protection. In his letters he speaks of “The good and
amiable Queen,” “the great Queen,” and so on. “I
am here,” he writes to Captain Ball, of the <i>Alexander</i>,
dated Palermo, January 21st, 1799, “nor will the King
or Queen allow me to move. I have offered to go to
Naples, and have wished to go off Malta in case the
Squadron from Brest should get near you, but neither
one or the other can weigh with them.” To Earl
Spencer he confides on the 6th March, “In Calabria the
people have cut down the Tree of Liberty; but I shall
never consider any part of the Kingdom of Naples safe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
or even Sicily, until I hear of the Emperor’s entering
Italy, when all my Ships shall go into the Bay of Naples,
and I think we can make a Revolution against the
French&mdash;at least, my endeavours shall not be wanting.
I hope to go on the service myself, but I have my doubts
if the King and Queen will consent to my leaving them
for a moment.” On the 20th of the same month he
tells St Vincent very much the same thing. “If the
Emperor moves, I hope yet to return the Royal Family
to Naples. At present, I cannot move. Would the Court
but let me, I should be better, I believe; for here I am
writing from morn to eve: therefore you must excuse
this jumble of a letter.”</p>

<p>And after evening what? Rumour, not altogether
devoid of fact, told strange tales of gambling continued
far into the night, of money made and money lost, of an
insidious enchantment which was beginning to sully
the fair soul of Britain’s greatest Admiral. How far
the influence of Lady Hamilton led Nelson to neglect his
duty is a debatable point. Admiral Mahan points out
that on the 22nd October 1798, Nelson wrote to Lord St
Vincent to the effect that he had given up his original
plan, “which was to have gone to Egypt and attend
to the destruction of the French shipping in that
quarter,” owing to the King’s desire that he should
return to Naples, after having arranged the blockade of
Malta. This and similar expressions, says Mahan,
“show the anxiety of his mind acting against his judgment.”
The late Judge O’Connor Morris, commenting
on this phase of the Hero’s career, is most emphatic
in his condemnation. His connection with Emma
Hamilton “kept him at Naples when he ought to have
been elsewhere; it led him to disobey a superior’s
orders, on one occasion when there was no excuse; it
perhaps prevented him from being present at the siege of
Malta. It exposed him, too, to just censure at home,
and gave pain and offence to his best friends; and the
consciousness that he was acting wrongly soured, in some
degree, his nature, and made him morose and at odds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
with faithful companions in arms.” For the defence
there are no more able advocates than Professor Sir J.
Knox Laughton and Mr James R. Thursfield, M.A.
Nelson, the former asserts, “in becoming the slave of a
beautiful and voluptuous woman, did not cease to be a
great commander. There is a common idea that his
passions detained him at Naples to the neglect of his
duty. This is erroneous. He made Naples his headquarters
because he was ordered to do so, to provide for
the safety of the kingdom and to take measures for the
reduction of Malta.” “The point to be observed and
insisted on,” Mr Thursfield says, “is that the whole of
this pitiful tragedy belongs only to the last seven years
of Nelson’s life.” He asks, “Why should the seven
years of private lapse be allowed to overshadow the
splendid devotion of a lifetime to public duty?” This
authority does not deny that during the two years
following the victory of the Nile Nelson’s genius
“suffered some eclipse,” that his passion for Lady
Hamilton was then “in its first transports, when he
seemed tied to the Court of the Two Sicilies by other
bonds than those of duty, when he annulled the capitulation
at Naples and insisted on the trial and execution
of Caracciolo,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> and when he repeatedly disobeyed the
orders of Lord Keith.” He further points out that the
period is the same “during which his mental balance
was more or less disturbed by the wound he had received
at the Nile, and his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour-propre</i> was deeply and justly
mortified by the deplorable blunder of the Admiralty
in appointing Lord Keith to the chief command in succession
to Lord St Vincent.” At the time with which
we are now dealing the latter disturbing element was
not present, although he was considerably worried by
the appointment of Captain Sir Sidney Smith as commander
of a squadron in the Levant, “within the district
which I had thought under my command.” “The
Knight forgets the respect due to his superior Officer”:
Nelson tells Lord St Vincent, “he has no orders from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
you to take my Ships away from my command; but
it is all of a piece. Is it to be borne? Pray grant me
your permission to retire, and I hope the <i>Vanguard</i>
will be allowed to convey me and my friends, Sir William
and Lady Hamilton, to England.” Mr Thursfield
makes no mention of this vexation, perhaps because the
matter distressed the Admiral less than Lord Keith’s
appointment. On the other hand, Nelson’s correspondence
contains frequent reference to the gratuitous
snub, which shows how deeply the iron had entered into
his soul. “<em>I do feel, for I am a man</em>, that it is impossible
for me to serve in these seas, with the Squadron under
a junior Officer:&mdash;could I have thought it!&mdash;and from
Earl Spencer!” is a typical instance. In the opinion of
the same biographer, “the influence of Lady Hamilton,
which ceased only with Nelson’s life, cannot have been
the sole cause, even if it was a contributory cause, of an
attitude and temper of mind which lasted only while
other causes were in operation and disappeared with
their cessation. The evil spirit which beset him, whatever
it may have been, had been exorcised for ever by
the time that he entered the Sound.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>... Yet the
influence of Lady Hamilton was not less potent then and
afterward than it was during the period of eclipse.
There are no letters in the Morrison Collection more
passionate than those which Nelson wrote to Lady
Hamilton at this time, none which show more clearly
that, as regards Lady Hamilton, and yet only in that
relation, his mental balance was still more than infirm,
his moral fibre utterly disorganized.”</p>

<p>With this verdict the present writer is in complete
accord. Nelson is to be censured for his moral breach
and any neglect of duty which may be traceable to it,
but to condemn him to infamy is to forget his subsequent
career and to consign to the flames many other
great figures of history.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the middle of March 1799 Troubridge returned
from the Levant, his command there having been
given to Sir Sidney Smith. Vexatious as was the
arrangement to both Nelson and Lord St Vincent, it
had one point of importance in its favour&mdash;and was to
have far-reaching results later&mdash;in that it enabled the
Admiral to send the trusted captain with several vessels
to blockade Naples. Troubridge was to “seize and get
possession” of the islands of Procida, Ischia, and Capri,
to use his influence with the inhabitants there and elsewhere,
“in order to induce them to return to their
allegiance to his Sicilian Majesty, and to take arms
to liberate their Country from French tyranny and
oppressive contributions.” On the 3rd April, Troubridge
was able to tell Nelson that “All the Ponza
Islands have the Neapolitan flag flying. Your Lordship
never beheld such loyalty; the people are perfectly mad
with joy, and are asking for their beloved Monarch.”
That Nelson’s hands were “full,” as he wrote to his
brother, is sufficiently evident. He had become “a
Councillor and Secretary of State,” to use his own words,
and his public correspondence, “besides the business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of sixteen Sail of the Line, and all our commerce, is with
Petersburg, Constantinople, the Consul at Smyrna,
Egypt, the Turkish and Russian Admirals, Trieste,
Vienna, Tuscany, Minorca, Earl St Vincent and Lord
Spencer.” Moreover, he was now Commander-in-Chief
of the Neapolitan Navy, and had been promoted to
Rear-Admiral of the Red. His health during this trying
period was far from good. He complained to his friend
the Duke of Clarence of being “seriously unwell,” and he
told Lord St Vincent, “I am almost blind and worn out,
and cannot, in my present state, hold out much longer.”
He seemed to be growing more despondent daily, the
good news of the success of the Austrian arms in Italy
“does not even cheer me.”</p>

<p>Victory no longer attended the French cause in the
northern part of the peninsula, and the forces of the
Republic were to evacuate it and to join the main French
army. On the 7th May, Ferdinand’s kingdom was
relieved of its unwelcome visitors, save only the garrisons
which were left at Capua and Caserta, and at the Castle
of St Elmo. The internal condition of the State, however,
was still far from settled. Commodore Caracciolo,
representing the Jacobins, commanded a miniature fleet
in Naples Bay; Cardinal Ruffo led a nondescript band
called by the high-sounding title of “the Christian
Army,” against the Neapolitan republicans, who were
in some force. The unhappy position of the Royal
Family at this time is well described by the Queen
in a letter to the Marquise d’Osmond, mother of the
Comtesse de Boigne. It is from the Appendix to the
first volume of the “Recollections” of the last-named
that the extract is taken. The communication is dated
from Palermo, the 2nd May 1799.</p>

<p>“We continue to live between hope and dread:”
she says, “the news varies every day. We are expecting
help from Russia: if it comes it will be of the greatest
service to us. The English render us the greatest
services. Were it not for them both Sicilies would be
democratised, I should be dead of grief or drowned in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the sea, or else, with my dear family, imprisoned in a
castle by our rebellious subjects. You can read in the
gazettes, without my naming them to you, how many
ungrateful subjects we have. It suffices to tell you that
in their writings and their ingratitude they have surpassed
their foster-mother France, but with us the classes
are different. Here it is the class which has the most
to lose which is the most violent; nobles, bishops,
monks, ordinary lawyers, but not the high magistracy,
nor the people. The latter are loyal, and show it on
every occasion.... My dear children have behaved
like angels in all our unfortunate circumstances. They
suffer every kind of privation they did not know before,
without complaining, out of love for me, so that I may
notice nothing. They are always good-humoured,
though they have no amusements.”</p>

<p>While Troubridge was clearing the way for the return
of the royal exiles to Naples, Nelson received the
startling intelligence that the Brest fleet of nineteen sail-of-the-line
had not only escaped but had been seen off
Oporto making for the Mediterranean. So far as it went,
the news was correct enough, but the French ships
numbered twenty-five instead of nineteen. Nelson’s
despondency and ill-health vanished; he lost not an
instant in making his arrangements. Troubridge was
recalled from Naples, and the “band of brothers” were
ordered to join Rear-Admiral Duckworth off Port
Mahon, Nelson’s belief being that the first item on the
French naval programme was the recovery of Minorca.
Shortly afterwards he came to think that Sicily was
the object of the enemy, whereupon he cancelled his
former instructions and made the island of Maritimo
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rendez-vous</i>. This station he reached on the 23rd
May with seven ships, which he hoped to bring up to
sixteen, Duckworth having decided to wait for Lord St
Vincent and not to reinforce Nelson. Ball, who had
been ordered to abandon the blockade of Malta, had
not arrived, and the delay filled the Admiral with
anxiety. “I can only have two queries about him&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>either
that he has gone round to Messina, imagining
that the French Fleet were close to him, or he is taken.
Thus situated,” he writes to Lord St Vincent, “I have
only to remain on the north side of Maritimo, to keep
covering Palermo, which shall be protected to the last,
and to wait intelligence or orders for regulating my
further proceedings.</p>

<p>“Your Lordship,” he adds, “may depend that the
Squadron under my command shall never fall into the
hands of the Enemy; and before we are destroyed, I
have little doubt but the Enemy will have their wings
so completely clipped that they may be easily overtaken.”</p>

<p>On the 28th May, Nelson heard from the Commander-in-chief
that Bruix and the French fleet had been sighted
off Cadiz on the 4th inst. by Keith’s blockading squadron,
the intention being to form a junction with the Spanish
fleet. In reply to Lord St Vincent’s despatch, Nelson
was able to tell his senior officer that “we are completely
on our guard,” that he had determined to go to Palermo
to get provisions and wine for six months, and to hold
his vessels “in momentary readiness to act as you may
order or the circumstances call for. My reason for
remaining in Sicily is the covering the blockade of
Naples, and the certainty of preserving Sicily in case of
an attack, for if we were to withdraw our Ships, it would
throw such a damp on the people that I am sure there
would be no resistance. But from the favourable
aspect of affairs in Italy, I am sure no attack will be
made here, whilst the French know we have such a force
to act against them. If Captain Ball has not entirely
given up the blockade of Malta, and the poor Islanders
have not given up to the French, I intend to continue
the blockade...; for as the danger from your happy
arrival is not so great, I will run the risk of the Ships
for a short time. The Russians will, I am told, be off
there in a week or fortnight. In all this plan I am
subject to your Lordship’s more able judgment. I
shall send a Frigate off Cape Corse, in case the French
Fleet should come to be eastward of Corsica, and if I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
can find a small craft, one shall be on the west side of
Sardinia, but the Bay of Naples draws me dry.” Two
days later, in writing to the same correspondent to
announce the safe arrival of the <i>Vanguard</i> at Palermo,
Nelson makes his usual acknowledgments of the services
of those under his command: “I have our dear Troubridge
for my assistant; in everything we are brothers.
Hood and Hallowell are as active and kind as ever:
not that I mean to say any are otherwise; but you know
these are men of resources. Hardy was bred in the old
school, and I can assure you, that I never have been
better satisfied with the real good discipline of a Ship
than the <i>Vanguard’s</i>. I hope from my heart that you
will meet the Dons alone: if the two Fleets join, I am
ready, and with some of my Ships in as high order as
ever went to sea.”</p>

<p>As it happened, Keith was able to prevent the junction
of the enemy’s fleets. His position was between them&mdash;between
“the devil and the deep sea,” as he termed it.
When the look-out frigates of the French fleet were
sighted between Corsica and Genoa, orders were received
from Lord St Vincent for Keith to return to Port Mahon,
which the former thought might be the object of attack.
Further despatches came to hand a little later, urging
Keith to proceed to Minorca. The Commander-in-chief
and Keith were really playing at cross-purposes, for
while St Vincent was acting only on supposition, Keith
was in touch with the enemy. It is probable in such
a case that Nelson would have led his squadron into
action, but Keith was not the type of man to risk acting
on his own initiative to any great extent, and left the
Frenchmen to proceed to Spezia.</p>

<p>On the 8th June, Nelson vacated the <i>Vanguard</i>,
hoisted his flag on the <i>Foudroyant</i> (80), and was strengthened
by the arrival of two ships from Lord St Vincent’s
fleet. He also heard of the impending resignation of the
Commander-in-chief, his indifferent health making him
“literally incapable of any service,” as he afterwards
wrote to Nelson. The unexpected news considerably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
distressed the Admiral. He felt sincere admiration and
regard for the gallant old sailor, who had served his King
so long and so faithfully, sentiments recorded in a letter
dated from Palermo, the 10th June 1799, as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We have a report that you are going home. This
distresses us most exceedingly, and myself in particular;
so much so, that I have serious thoughts of returning,
if that event should take place. But for the sake of our
Country, do not quit us at this serious moment. I wish
not to detract from the merit of whoever may be your
successor; but it must take a length of time, which I
hope the war will not give, to be in any manner a St
Vincent. We look up to you, as we have always found
you, as to our Father, under whose fostering care we
have been led to fame. If, my dear Lord, I have any
weight in your friendship, let me entreat you to rouse
the sleeping lion. Give not up a particle of your authority
to any one; be again our St Vincent, and we shall be
happy. Your affectionate</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Nelson</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>To the Admiral’s supreme disgust his own claims to
the appointment were disregarded. Lord St Vincent’s
command was given to Lord Keith, who had the additional
good fortune to find that the French fleet was
in Vado Bay. Nelson, urged on by Ferdinand and
perhaps by Lady Hamilton, was on his voyage to Naples
with a body of troops to render assistance to the royalists,
when two British sail-of-the-line hove in sight. One
of them bore an important despatch from Keith, to the
effect that not only was the enemy at sea but likely to be
bound towards Nelson. The latter immediately returned
to Palermo, disembarked the soldiers and their
munitions, and cruised off Maritimo. Here he hoped
to be joined by the <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Goliath</i>, which he had
ordered to proceed from Malta some days before. Provided
they arrived his force would be raised to eighteen
battleships, including three Portuguese&mdash;four less than
the enemy. “I shall wait off Maritimo,” he says, in reply
to Keith, “anxiously expecting such a reinforcement as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
may enable me to go in search of the Enemy’s fleet, when
not one moment shall be lost in bringing them to battle;
for I consider the best defence for his Sicilian Majesty’s
Dominions, is to place myself alongside the French.”
No further ships arrived, and Nelson therefore returned
to Palermo. Keith’s neglect aroused Nelson’s wrath
to such an extent, that while he was at sea he sent a copy
of the above letter to the Earl of St Vincent, complaining
that the Commander-in-chief had not sent him
“a force fit to face the Enemy: but, as we are, I
shall not get out of their way; although, as I am, I
cannot think myself justified in exposing the world (I
may almost say), to be plundered by these miscreants.
I trust your Lordship will not think me wrong in the
painful determination I conceived myself forced to make,
for agonized indeed was the mind of your Lordship’s
faithful and affectionate servant.”</p>

<p>Mahan remarks that Nelson’s station off Maritimo
was strategically sound, enabling him to intercept the
approach of the enemy “to either Naples or Sicily,”
and it was while he was cruising here that he received
a despatch from his former Commander-in-chief to the
effect that Keith was searching for the French, and that
reinforcements were making their way to Port Mahon.
Nelson was convinced that the enemy was steering for
Naples. After a brief visit to the King at Palermo and
receiving Sir William and Lady Hamilton on board the
<i>Foudroyant</i>, he sailed for the capital.</p>

<p>On Troubridge’s withdrawal from Naples, the blockade
had been placed in the hands of Captain Foote
of the <i>Seahorse</i>, a frigate of thirty-eight guns, who concerted
with Ruffo and his Russian and Turkish allies to
rid the city of the insurgents. Fort St Elmo, garrisoned
by the few remaining French, and the castles of Uovo
and Nuovo, held by the rebels, alone held out. The
Cardinal arranged an armistice with the insurgents, and
although there was further trouble, the matter was
patched up and negotiations were again begun. Subsequently
a capitulation was signed on the 23rd June.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Nelson received the news before his squadron anchored
in the Bay of Naples on the following day, and, not
knowing the exact terms on which it had been granted,
characterised them as “infamous.”</p>

<p>The main conditions were that the forts Nuovo and
Uovo should be delivered up with their effects; that
the troops should keep possession of the places until the
ships which were to be provided for those who wished
to proceed to Toulon were ready to sail; that the
garrisons should march out with the honours of war;
that “Persons and Property, both movable and immovable,
of every individual of the two Garrisons, shall
be respected and guaranteed,” a clause applicable also
to prisoners which the allies had made during the blockade
of the forts; and that “All the other hostages and State
prisoners, confined in the two Forts, shall be set at
liberty, immediately after the present Capitulation is
signed.” Nelson at once ordered Foote to haul down
the flag of truce flying from the <i>Seahorse</i>. Sufficient of
his story has been told to show that the Admiral had
little or no pity for rebels. So far back as the 6th June,
he had written to Foote that the intelligence sent to him
by that officer of the hanging of thirteen Jacobins “gave
us great pleasure,” and he also expressed the hope that
three priests who had been condemned would “dangle
on the tree best adapted to their weight of sins.” Without
further ado he sent a declaration to “the Rebellious
Subjects” in the two forts that “They must surrender
themselves to His Majesty’s Royal mercy,” and addressed
a summons to the Commanding Officer of the
French at the Castle of St Elmo, that he must either
accede to the terms made by Ruffo and the Russian
Commander, or “take the consequences, as I shall not
agree to any other.” A paper signed by Nelson and
explained to Ruffo, but rejected by him, announced that
“the British Admiral proposes to the Cardinal to send,
in their joint names, to the French and Rebels, that the
arrival of the British fleet has completely destroyed the
compact, as would that of the French if they had had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the power (which, thank God, they have not) to come
to Naples.... That as to Rebels and Traitors, no power
on earth has a right to stand between their gracious King
and them: they must instantly throw themselves on the
clemency of their Sovereign, for no other terms will be
allowed them; nor will the French be allowed even to
name them in any capitulation. If these terms are not
complied with, in the time ... viz., two hours for the
French, and instant submission on the part of the Rebels&mdash;such
very favourable conditions will never be again
offered.”</p>

<p>Nelson knew the man with whom he was dealing, and
as the following characteristic letter to Rear-Admiral
Duckworth shows, he was quite prepared for any
eventuality. With insurgents on land and the possibility
of a French fleet at sea in the near vicinity, it was
incumbent on the British Admiral not to run unnecessary
<span class="locked">risks:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“As you will believe, the Cardinal and myself have
begun our career by a complete difference of opinion. He
will send the Rebels to Toulon,&mdash;I say they shall not go.
He thinks one house in Naples more to be prized than
his Sovereign’s honour. Troubridge and Ball are gone
to the Cardinal, for him to read my declaration to the
French and Rebels, whom he persists in calling patriots&mdash;what
a prostitution of the word! I shall send Foote
to get the Gun-boats from Procida. I wish the Fleet
not to be more than two-thirds of a cable from each other.
I shall send you a sketch of the anchorage, in forty
fathom water. The <i>Foudroyant</i> to be the Van-ship.
If the French fleet should favour us with a visit, I can
easily take my station in the centre.”</p>

<p>The Cardinal positively refused to entertain Nelson’s
opinions, but after some hesitation decided to discuss
affairs with him on the <i>Foudroyant</i>. The interview,
which was stormy on both sides and somewhat protracted,
owing to the necessity of employing Lord and Lady
Hamilton as interpreters, took place on the afternoon of
the 25th. Both of them held steadfastly to his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
point of view. Nelson therefore wrote that “in his
opinion” the Treaty with the rebels “cannot be carried
into execution, without the approbation of his Sicilian
Majesty.”</p>

<p>Uovo and Nuovo were taken possession of by British
seamen under Troubridge on the evening of the 26th inst.,
and on the following day, Nelson communicated the
fact to the Admiralty, adding: “This morning I am
going to send a detachment under Captain Troubridge,
to cut down the dangerous Tree of Anarchy, and to burn
it before the King’s palace. The moment I can find the
City a little quieted, guns shall be got against St Elmo,
when, I am sure, the French will be glad to surrender....
In my present position, I have not the smallest
alarm should the Enemy favour us with a visit, inferior
as my force is to oppose them.” The castle capitulated
on the 12th July 1799, to Nelson’s “brave friend”
Troubridge, whose “great character,” “ability and
resources” were duly detailed to Lord Keith, while the
Admiral told Earl Spencer that, “On land the captain
of the <i>Culloden</i> is a first-rate general!” Troubridge’s
reward was a baronetcy, to which no one ever had a
clearer title.</p>

<p>Was Nelson justified in cancelling the agreement
entered into by Ruffo and his allies and the enemy? The
question has been discussed with great vehemence and
at prodigious length. Mahan’s opinion is that “his
conduct throughout was open and consistent.” He is
convinced that the Admiral acted up to his firm belief
“that he not only had a right to suspend the Capitulation,
because, though signed, it had not been executed, but
that it was his bounden duty so to do; having both
legal power and adequate force to prevent its execution.”
Nelson “regarded himself as, and for the time being
actually was, the representative of the King of the Two
Sicilies, as well as the admiral of the British fleet. As
representative, he was charged with the interests and
honour of the Sovereign and had authority over all
Neapolitan officials; as admiral, he wielded power to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
enforce obedience, if refused. Considering the terms of
the Capitulation to be contrary to the interests and the
honour of the Kingdom, he was under an obligation to
prevent their going into effect, until the King’s decision,
becoming known, should supersede his own discretion.”</p>

<p>Laughton, whose biography of Nelson is much shorter
than Mahan’s, and is therefore not so comprehensive,
dismisses the matter by saying, “it is perfectly well
established as the usage of civilised war that terms
granted by a military officer are conditional on the
approval of his superiors, unless he has distinct authority
to negotiate, or the capitulation has been effected wholly
or in part. In the present instance Cardinal Ruffo had
not only no authority to negotiate, but he had express
orders from the King not to do so.” By the fourth
Article of the “Instructions to the troops of his Majesty,
ordered to repair to the Bay of Naples,” dated Palermo,
June 10th, 1799, “All the military and political operations
shall be agreed upon by the Prince Royal and
Admiral Lord Nelson. The opinion of this latter always
to have a preponderance, on account of the respect due
to his experience, as well as to the forces under his command,
which will determine the operations; and also
because we are so deeply indebted to him for the zeal
and attachment of which he has given so many proofs.”
By the tenth Article, “The acts of clemency concerning
the noted offenders, and the pardoning of the same, are
reserved for the King, excepting those stipulated in the
articles of capitulation.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>The Execution of Caracciolo</p>

<p class="notbold">Stephen Reid</p></div></div>

<p>About seventy Jacobins were executed for their
misdeeds, but Nelson was only concerned in the death
of one of them. Commodore Francesco Caracciolo, the
commander of the Republican Navy, had previously
accompanied the Sicilian Court to Palermo, but when
an edict was issued by the French that the property of all
absentees would be confiscated, he had obtained King
Ferdinand’s permission to return. Marshal Macdonald,
then Commander-in-chief of the French Army of Naples,
refers to the matter in his “Recollections.” “I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
resolved,” he writes, “to induce Admiral Caracciolo
to take service in the new fleet; he equipped a flotilla
which secured respect for the port and coasts of Naples,
frequently threatened by attempts of the English, who
occupied the islands and were stationed in the roads.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
When Caracciolo’s position on sea became untenable,
he sought a safer asylum in one of the forts, whence he
eventually fled to the mountains disguised as a peasant.
Here he was discovered and captured. The refugee was
brought on board the <i>Foudroyant</i> on the morning of the
29th June. Nelson at once instructed Count Thurn,
Commander of the Sicilian frigate <i>La Minerva</i>, who had
been in action with Caracciolo, to assemble five of the
senior officers under his command to inquire if the
prisoner were guilty of rebellion against his lawful
Sovereign, and having fired at his Sicilian Majesty’s
colours on board <i>La Minerva</i>. The trial duly took place;
the sentence was death. This was to be carried out
“by hanging him at the fore yard-arm of His Sicilian
Majesty’s Frigate <i>La Minerva</i>, under your command,
at five o’clock this evening; and to cause him to hang
there until sunset, when you will have his body cut down,
and thrown into the sea.” Such were Nelson’s instructions,
which were obeyed. Parsons, who had charge of
Caracciolo, describes him as “a short, thick-set man, of
apparent strength, but haggard with misery and want;
his clothing in wretched condition, but his countenance
denoting stern resolution to endure that misery like a
man.” The sympathetic narrator persists in calling
him “veteran” and “old man.” The Commodore was
only forty-seven years of age, although his wan appearance
may have made him look considerably older.
“At two o’clock in the afternoon,” Parsons adds, “the
veteran, with a firm step, walked into Lord Nelson’s
barge, and with a party of thirty of our seamen, under
one of our lieutenants, was taken to his [Count Thurn’s]
flagship, the gun fired, and the brave old man launched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
into eternity at the expiration of the two hours from
the time the sentence had passed. The seamen of our
fleet, who clustered on the rigging like bees, consoled
themselves that it was only an Italian prince, and the
admiral of Naples, that was hanging&mdash;a person of very
light estimation compared with the lowest man in
a British ship. His Majesty of Naples, the Prime
Minister, Sir John Acton, and many of the foreign
ambassadors, joined and took up their quarters in the
<i>Foudroyant</i> two days after the execution; and my Lord
Nelson removed to the first lieutenant’s cabin as his
sleeping apartment, giving his cabin to the king’s use,
and the larboard side of the maindeck for his cooks,
who condescended to officiate as ours; and never did
midshipmen fare so sumptuously as during the king’s
long stay on board the <i>Foudroyant</i>. The day was passed
in administering justice (Italian fashion) to the wretches
who fell into the grasp of Cardinal Ruffo’s lambs,
enlivened by the bombardment of St Elmo, which we
were battering in breach. At noon, dinner was served
to the royal party and their guests on the quarter-deck;
Lady Hamilton’s graceful form bending over her harp,
and her heavenly music gave a gusto to the dessert.
As the sun went down, the opera singers, in a large,
decked galley, came alongside, and all that could delight
the ear or please the eye was there to fascinate and
charm.”</p>

<p>There is more than a suspicion of irony in the above
passage. It is useful because one can readily believe
that it was the point of view of the majority of the
British petty officers and seamen. They failed to understand
why so much deference should be shown to King
Ferdinand and his Queen, who doubtless in their opinion
would have shown more royal qualifications had they
remained in their capital instead of making a hasty
flight to Palermo. This is not the place to discuss the
merits and demerits of monarchy and republic, both of
which have their advantages. Certainly the foreign
policy of Great Britain at the end of the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
century did not allow an ally to be dethroned without
making an effort on his behalf.</p>

<p>Southey, when dealing with the execution of Caracciolo,
has seen fit to introduce Nelson’s relations with Lady
Hamilton into the matter, which may be forgiven a man
who published his narrative in 1813, when current
scandal and gossip were often the chief “authorities”
of the historian. “Doubtless” he remarks, “the
British Admiral seemed to himself to be acting under
a rigid sense of justice, but to all other persons it was
obvious that he was influenced by an infatuated
attachment&mdash;a baneful passion, which destroyed his
domestic happiness, and now, in a second instance,
stained ineffaceably his public character.” Now Lady
Hamilton, as a matter of actual fact, had nothing whatever
to do with the hanging of the traitor and did not
converse with the Admiral during Caracciolo’s detention.
The rebel was tried by those of his own nationality, and
according to Mahan, “there is no ground for doubting
that he (Nelson) had authority to order a court-martial,
and to carry its sentence into execution, nor that
Caracciolo came within the jurisdiction of a court-martial
properly constituted.” It is only just to add, however,
that in the opinion of the same eminent authority there
was no real necessity for such undue haste on Nelson’s
part. “He should have remembered that the act would
appear to the world, not as that of the Neapolitan
plenipotentiary, but of the British officer, and that his
nation, while liable like others to bursts of unreasoning
savagery, in its normal moods delights to see justice
clothed in orderly forms, unstained by precipitation or
suspicion of perversion, advancing to its ends with the
majesty of law, without unseemly haste, providing things
honest in the sight of all men. That he did not do so,
when he could have done so, has been intuitively felt;
and to the instinctive resentment thus aroused among
his countrymen has been due the facility with which
the worst has been too easily believed.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">King Ferdinand</span> was again on board the
<i>Foudroyant</i>, holding his Levées on the quarter-deck,
and making himself as affable as was
possible to a man of his morose temperament. Nelson’s
infatuation for the welfare of his Majesty and his kingdom
seemed growing. The castle of St Elmo had
fallen, thereby completing the conquest of Naples, but
the Admiral saw fit to order Troubridge to march against
Capua, thereby denuding the fleet of a thousand men,
who were to act in concert with four times that number
of troops. This was done after the receipt of a warning
from Keith that it might be necessary to withdraw the
squadron for the protection of Minorca.</p>

<p>“Should such an order come at this moment,” Nelson
writes to Earl Spencer, “it would be a cause for some
consideration whether Minorca is to be risked, or the
two Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily? I rather think
my decision would be to risk the former.” In other
words, Nelson placed the interests of an allied Power
before those of his own country, although of course his
services to the Sicilies were of importance to the latter.
One cannot help thinking that there is more than a
suspicion of ulterior motives in what was to lead to a
flagrant disobedience of orders. The letter concludes
with the most affectionate references to Sir William and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Lady Hamilton, who were assuredly his evil genii at the
moment. According to Nelson they were with him to
his “great comfort,” without them “it would have been
impossible I could have rendered half the service to
his Majesty which I have now done: their heads and
their hearts are equally great and good.” Writing to
Keith on the same day&mdash;13th July 1799&mdash;he refers solely
to King Ferdinand: “It has been and is my study to
treat his Majesty with all the respect due to so great a
personage, and I have the pleasure to believe that my
humble endeavours have met with the Royal approbation.”</p>

<p>After penning this communication the Admiral
received a despatch from Keith, dated the 27th June,
implicitly requiring him “to send such Ships as you can
possibly spare off the Island of Minorca to wait my
orders.” This he acknowledged by saying that “as soon
as the safety of His Sicilian Majesty’s Kingdoms is
secured, I shall not lose one moment in making the
detachment you are pleased to order. At present, under
God’s Providence, the safety of His Sicilian Majesty, and
his speedy restoration to his Kingdom, depends on this
Fleet, and the confidence inspired even by the appearance
of our Ships before the City is beyond all belief;
and I have no scruple in declaring my opinion that should
any event draw us from the Kingdom, that if the French
remain in any part of it, disturbances will again arise,
for all order having been completely overturned, it must
take a thorough cleansing, and some little time, to restore
tranquillity.” In order to justify his conduct, Nelson
next sent a second note to Earl Spencer. After referring
to his previous letter, which showed that he was prepared
for Keith’s order, he adds, “more than ever is my
mind made up, that, at this moment, I will not part with
a single Ship, as I cannot do that without drawing a
hundred and twenty men from each Ship now at the
Siege of Capua, where an Army is gone this day. I am
fully aware of the act I have committed; but, sensible
of my loyal intentions, I am prepared for any fate which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
may await my disobedience. Capua and Gaeta will
soon fall; and the moment the scoundrels of French
are out of this Kingdom, I shall send eight or nine Ships
of the Line to Minorca. I have done what I thought
right; others may think differently; but it will be my
consolation that I have gained a Kingdom, seated a
faithful Ally of his Majesty firmly on his throne, and
restored happiness to millions. Do not think, my dear
Lord, that my opinion is formed from the arrangements
of any one. <em>No</em>; be it good, or be it bad, it is all my
own.” The writer concludes with an appeal for Earl
Spencer’s interest with the Board of the Admiralty,
which was not vouchsafed. His having proceeded to
the Bay of Naples and of the operations against the
castle of St Elmo were approved, but not of the land
warfare carried on by the seamen against Capua. Their
Lordships did not see “sufficient reason to justify your
having disobeyed the orders you had received from your
Commanding-Officer, or having left Minorca exposed
to the risk of being attacked, without having any Naval
force to protect it.”</p>

<p>On the 19th July, Nelson was handed a second urgent
despatch from Keith, ordering him either to leave Sicily
and repair to Minorca with his whole force or to detach
the greater part of his squadron and place it under
Duckworth. Keith’s “repeated information” led him
to believe that the enemy was not making for Sicily or
Egypt, as had been thought probable, but for Ireland.
Nelson again refused to obey his Commander-in-chief.
Not until the 22nd inst., when Keith informed Nelson
that the French fleet was off Cape Tres Forcas, did he
see fit to dispatch Duckworth with four vessels to
Minorca.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen succeeded in joining their Spanish
allies at Cartagena and arriving safely at Brest,
from which port they did not issue for some months,
an event which does not therefore concern us at the
moment. Capua and Gaeta eventually surrendered,
the articles of capitulation being signed by Acton and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Nelson on behalf of King Ferdinand on the 31st July
1799, thus liberating “the Kingdom of Naples from a
band of robbers,” as the Admiral informed Keith.</p>

<p>So far this portion of the narrative has been necessarily
confined to cold, matter-of-fact details. Mention must
now be made of the celebrations held on the first anniversary
of the battle of the Nile. Well might Nelson
be fêted on such an occasion; he had served their
Sicilian Majesties all too faithfully. He thus describes
the picturesque scene for the benefit of his <span class="locked">wife:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Thank God all goes well in Italy, and the Kingdom
of Naples is liberated from thieves and murderers. But
still, it has so overthrown the fabric of a regular Government,
that much time and great care are necessary to
keep the Country quiet. The 1st of August was celebrated
here with as much respect as our situation would
admit. The King dined with me; and, when His
Majesty drank my health, a Royal salute of twenty-one
guns was fired from all his Sicilian Majesty’s Ships of
War, and from all the Castles. In the evening there was
a general illumination. Amongst other representations,
a large Vessel was fitted out like a Roman galley; on its
oars were fixed lamps, and in the centre was erected a
rostral column with my name: at the stern were
elevated two angels supporting my picture. In short,
my dear Fanny, the beauty of the whole is beyond
my powers of description. More than 2000 variegated
lamps were suspended round the Vessel. An
orchestra was fitted up, and filled with the very best
musicians and singers. The piece of music was in a great
measure to celebrate my praise, describing their previous
distress, ‘but Nelson came, the invincible Nelson, and
they were preserved, and again made happy.’ This
must not make you think me vain; no, far, very far
from it, I relate it more from gratitude than vanity.
I return to Palermo with the King to-morrow.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>It was characteristic of Nelson’s fond regard for his
father that when King Ferdinand created him Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Bronté, which he believed would mean an increase of
some £3000 a year to his income, he taxed the estate to
the extent of £500 per annum on behalf of the Rev.
Edmund Nelson as “a mark of gratitude to the best of
parents.”</p>

<p>Keith being on the look-out for the forty ships of the
allied fleets&mdash;for Bruix had been joined by the Spanish
fleet at Cartagena as previously mentioned&mdash;the chief
command devolved upon Nelson. Unfortunately Keith
was unable to come up with the enemy, who entered
Brest without being brought to battle. He then
returned to England. Nelson hoped that the Lords of
the Admiralty would make his temporary command
permanent. Why they failed to do so is not quite clear.
Keith was sent back, and resumed command in the
following January. The situation was a most difficult
one for Nelson, especially as the King of the Two
Sicilies invariably showed the white feather when Nelson
wished to conduct him to Naples: “nothing can move
him.” The Admiral’s health was still unsatisfactory.
“I am almost blind, and truly very unwell.” He was
worried because the naval force had been withdrawn
from the coast of Italy, worried about the siege of Malta,
and worried by the stupidity of his Russian and Turkish
allies. But he maintained a bold front, and never
let the respective commanders know what he thought of
them. Instead, he wrote the most reassuring messages
to everybody, knowing and appreciating full well the
value of optimism.</p>

<p>In September 1799, we find his squadron disposed at
six different points, namely off Alexandria and the coast
of Egypt, under Sir Sidney Smith; off Malta, under
the Portuguese Rear-Admiral the Marquis de Niza;
at Palermo; on the coast of Naples and the Roman
coast, under Troubridge; on the north coast of Italy;
and blockading Cadiz and protecting the Straits of
Gibraltar, Minorca, etc., which is sufficient to show
that his task was an arduous one. He endeavoured to
stir up enthusiasm in the land forces on behalf of Malta,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Civita Vecchia, and Rome. To Sir James Erskine, at
Port Mahon, he wrote with all the eloquence he could
command to incite him to effort: “The field of glory is a
large one, and was never more open to any one than at this
moment to you. Rome would throw open her gates
and receive you as a deliverer; and the Pope<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> would
owe his restoration to the Papal Chair to an <em>heretic</em>.
This is the first great object, as it would not only be the
complete deliverance of Italy, but restore peace and
tranquillity to the torn-to-pieces Kingdom of Naples....
The next great object is the reduction of Malta, and in
any other moment than the present, it would be a most
important one.... To return to the first object, I can
take upon me to say, that our King would be much
gratified that <em>Britain</em> not <em>Austria</em> should re-instate the
Pope. You are at perfect liberty to say this from me;
for the world sees the ambition of Austria, and her eagle
wants to extend her wings from the Adriatic to the
Mediterranean. I will not say more, but that I will
support you to the utmost of my abilities.” Succour did
not come from Erskine but from a division of troops
sent by the veteran Russian commander Suwarrow,
and, on the 1st October, Nelson was able to inform the
Admiralty of the terms entered into with the French by
Troubridge for the evacuation of Rome and Civita
Vecchia, “on which event I sincerely congratulate their
Lordships.”</p>

<p>On the 15th of the same month Nelson sent the
“Sketch of my Life,” already remarked upon,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> to Mr
John McArthur of the “Naval Chronicle,” in which he
says that when the terms of capitulation were signed on
board the <i>Culloden</i>, “a prophecy, made to me on my
arrival at Naples, was fulfilled, viz., ‘<em>that I should take
Rome with my Ships</em>.’”</p>

<p>“Thus,” he concludes, “may be exemplified by my
Life that perseverance in my profession will most
probably meet its reward. Without having any inheritance,
or being fortunate in prize money, I have received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
all the honours of my profession, been created a Peer of
Great Britain, and I may say to thee, reader:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">“‘<i>Go thou and do likewise.</i>’”</p></blockquote>

<p>Nelson’s enthusiasm in the matter of Italy was due
partly to the magnificent series of victories which the
armies of the coalition had won. Alessandria and
Mantua had fallen, Moreau had retreated near Novi, and
Tortona had surrendered. So far everything seemed
to be pitched in a major key, but the minor element
entered when the Russians were sent into Switzerland
instead of being allowed to finish their task in Italy.
Masséna won the battle of Zurich, thereby severing the
communications between the Austro-Russian forces in
Switzerland and in Italy. In October the intrepid
Suwarrow, crossing the Alps, withdrew his forces to
Bavaria for the purpose of taking up winter quarters,
declining to further expose his worn-out troops.</p>

<p>In the same month another and more important event
happened, which was to be far-reaching in its results.
On the 9th of that month Napoleon, having been
fortunate enough to escape the vigilance of British
cruisers during his long and tedious voyage from Alexandria,
landed in France. Nelson did not hear the news
until the 24th, when he told Sir Sidney Smith, “I have
just got a report that appears to have some foundation,
that Buonaparte has passed Corsica in a Bombard,
steering for France. No Crusader ever returned with
more humility&mdash;contrast his going in <i>L’Orient</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c.”
Nelson was not on intimate terms with Smith, and was
therefore not likely to relieve his mind “against French
villany” as he did to Earl Spencer: “The great object
of the war is&mdash;<em>Down, down with the French!</em>” “If
I could have any Cruisers,” he said in another letter,
“as was my plan, off Cape Bon, in Africa, and between
Corsica and Toulon, Mr Buonaparte could not probably
have got to France; but if it bring on a confusion at
Paris, I hope it will be for the best.” “I have regretted
sincerely the escape of Buonaparte”; he tells the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Elgin, British ambassador at Constantinople; “but those
Ships which were destined by me for the two places
where he would certainly have been intercepted, were,
from the Admiralty thinking, doubtless, that the
Russians would do something at sea, obliged to be at
Malta, and other services which I thought the Russian
Admiral would have assisted me in&mdash;therefore, no blame
lays at my door.” Again, “Our news here is of a civil
war in France&mdash;Buonaparte against Barras. May God
increase their confusion.”</p>

<p>While Sir Sidney Smith had been eminently successful
at the siege of Acre, which made Napoleon miss his
“destiny” and precluded him from changing “the face
of the world,” as he himself stated, the defeat of the
Turks after their disembarkation at Aboukir in July
considerably altered the condition of affairs. Smith and
the Turkish Government were for allowing the French
to return to their native country, an arrangement not
at all in accord with Nelson’s wishes. “I own my hope
yet is,” he confesses to the Earl of Elgin, “that the
Sublime Porte will never permit a single Frenchman to
quit Egypt; and I own myself wicked enough to wish
them all to die in that Country they chose to invade.
We have scoundrels of French enough in Europe without
them.... I again take the liberty of repeating that
it is contrary to my opinion, allowing a single Frenchman
from Egypt to return during the war to France.
It would [be a] paper I never would subscribe to;
but I submit to the better judgment of men.” To
Spencer Smith, Secretary of Embassy, Constantinople,
he says much the same thing: “I cannot bring myself
to believe they would entirely quit Egypt; and, if they
would, I never would consent to one of them returning
to the Continent of Europe during the war. I wish them
to <em>perish</em> in Egypt, and give a great lesson to the world
of the justice of the <span class="smcap">Almighty</span>.” “I would have kept
up a more constant communication with Egypt;” he
tells Keith on the 7th January 1800, “but I have never
had the benefit of small Vessels.” When the Admiral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
heard of the Convention of El Arish, concluded by Smith
and Kléber&mdash;Napoleon’s successor in Egypt&mdash;Nelson
was furious. By its terms the army and its munitions
were to be allowed to return to France. Had Nelson
been Commander-in-chief, he would have refused “to
ratify any consent or approbation of Sir Sidney Smith,”
and would never “for a moment have forgot my text&mdash;that
at all risks of giving offence, <em>not one Frenchman
should be allowed to quit Egypt</em>.” Keith showed a firm
hand when the intelligence reached him. He would
consent to “no Capitulation with the French Army in
Egypt, except as prisoners of war,” and he insisted on
the abandoning of all ships and munitions. Moreover,
no troops were to return until they were exchanged. In
due course the British Government consented to the
terms which had been made, although it disapproved of
Sir Sidney Smith’s high-handed policy. On Kléber
being informed of the conditions imposed on him by
Keith, he refused to entertain them. Hostilities were
renewed before the receipt of the Order from England
confirming the capitulation, and the negotiations came
to nothing.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Malta</span> was in a pitiful, half-starved condition.
Nelson urged Sir James Erskine at Mahon,
and Brigadier-General Graham at Messina,
to send troops to its relief. They were as adamant and
refused. He was therefore kept “in desperation about
Malta” until General Fox arrived at Minorca and
released the garrison there for the more urgent necessities
of the unhappy island. The Russians upon whom
the Admiral had also depended were sent elsewhere
in pursuance of the Czar’s plan to withdraw from the
enfeebled coalition.</p>

<p>The Portuguese having withdrawn their ships from
the blockade, it was eminently necessary to fill their
place, especially as it was understood that a French
squadron was likely to be sent to the relief of the beleaguered.
Keith was back at his post in January
1800, and was off Leghorn with Nelson on the 20th of
that month. After proceeding to Palermo they both
went to Malta, where the exciting news was received that
the enemy had not only left port but had been seen off
the west end of Sicily.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-chief remained at Malta ready
to give the Frenchmen a warm welcome should they
come his way; Nelson was dispatched to capture the
Republican squadron. This consisted of the famous
<i>Généreux</i>, the 74-gun ship, which had escaped after the
battle of the Nile, three corvettes, and an armed store-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>ship.
The Admiral had three sail-of-the-line at his
service, when he came up with Rear-Admiral Perrée
on the 18th February 1800, but the chase had already
been started by the <i>Alexander</i>, which happened to be
cruising near. The French store-ship struck her tricoloured
ensign after a few shots had been fired, and was
promptly secured. The <i>Généreux</i> was then raked with
several broadsides by the <i>Success</i> frigate, a compliment
returned by the Frenchman to the disadvantage of the
British crew, of which one man was killed and the Master
and seven men wounded. When the <i>Foudroyant</i> and
the <i>Northumberland</i> approached, and began to fight
in real earnest, the enemy’s flagship fired her broadside
and surrendered. The corvettes made good their
escape. Perrée died of his wounds on the following
day. His flag was sent by the Admiral to Leopold,
Prince of Salerno, through Sir John Acton, who described
King Ferdinand’s son as being “in raptures” at the
present.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the blockade of Malta was entrusted to
Nelson by Keith, the Commander-in-chief sailing for
Genoa to assist the Austrians in the siege of that place,
which eventually fell in the first week of the following
June. The position was an ignominious one from
Nelson’s point of view, as his letters testify. He told
his superior that “Without some rest, I am gone,”
and that he was “absolutely exhausted.” In referring
to Keith in a note to Lord Minto he underlines “<em>my
Commander-in-chief</em>,” for a reason which is fairly
obvious. “Ought I to trust Dame Fortune any more?”
he asks, “her daughter may wish to step in and tear the
mother from me. I have in truth serious thoughts of
giving up active service&mdash;Greenwich Hospital seems a
fit retreat for me after being <em>evidently</em> thought unfit to
command in the Mediterranean.” “<em>We of the Nile</em> are
not equal to Lord Keith in his (Acton’s) estimation, and
ought to think it an honour to serve under such a <em>clever</em>
man,” he tells Troubridge. “I can say little good of
myself: I am far from well”; “My state of health is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
very precarious. Two days ago I dropped with a pain
in my heart, and I am always in a fever”; “my very
ill state of health”; “I believe I am almost finished,”
are passages to be found in his correspondence at this
period. He informed Keith that his health was “so
very indifferent,” that he was obliged “in justice to
myself, to retire to Palermo for a few weeks, and to
direct Troubridge to carry on the service during my
necessary absence. I shall quit this station when
matters are all put in a right way.”</p>

<p>Troubridge heard of Nelson’s decision with unfeigned
sorrow. “I beseech you,” he says in a note of such
sincere regard and affection that it is worthy of place in
any “Life of Nelson,” “hear the entreaties of a sincere
friend, and do not go to Sicily for the present.”</p>

<p>Nelson paid no heed to the warning, and proceeded to
Palermo. While returning to Malta the <i>Foudroyant</i>
was able to render assistance to the <i>Penelope</i> (36) frigate,
which was following the <i>Guillaume Tell</i> (86) in much the
same way as a sturdy little terrier sometimes follows
a much larger dog. After some hours the <i>Lion</i> (64)
came up, followed by the <i>Foudroyant</i>. The <i>Guillaume
Tell</i>&mdash;the sole remaining sail-of-the-line which had
escaped at the Nile&mdash;was endeavouring to break the
blockade of Valetta, but the time had come for her last
fight with the undaunted foe. She surrendered after a
splendid resistance on Sunday morning, the 30th March,
and was towed in a very crippled and dismasted state to
Syracuse. In due course she was refitted and rendered
good service in the British navy as the <i>Malta</i>. Rear-Admiral
Decrès was wounded and taken prisoner, and
some 200 of the 1220 men on his flagship were either
killed or rendered <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Berry, who commanded the <i>Foudroyant</i>,
wrote a hasty letter giving Nelson a few particulars.
“I had but one wish this morning&mdash;it was for you,”
is the opening sentence, “How we prayed for you, God
knows, and your sincere and faithful friend,” are the
concluding words. Could better evidence be produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
of the love which animated Nelson and his “band of
brothers”? “My task is done, my health is lost, and
the orders of the great Earl of St Vincent are completely
fulfilled&mdash;thanks, ten thousand thanks, to my
brave friends!” Thus he wrote to Berry on the 5th
April 1800, and on the following day he made similar
remarks to Lord Minto: “Our dear great Earl of St
Vincent’s orders to me were to follow the French Mediterranean
fleet, and to annihilate them: it has been done,
thanks to the zeal and bravery of my gallant friends!
My task is done, my health lost, and I have wrote to Lord
Keith for my retreat. May all orders be as punctually
obeyed, but never again an Officer at the close, of what
I must, without being thought vain, (for such I am
represented by my enemies,) call a glorious career, be so
treated! I go with our dear friends Sir William and
Lady Hamilton; but whether by water or land depends
on the will of Lord Keith.” Again and again Nelson
refers to the prowess of his comrades in arms. “The
happy capture of the <i>William Tell</i>,” he writes to the
Capitan Pacha, “is the finish to the whole French fleet,
which my Royal Master desired me to destroy. Having,
by the bravery of the Officers and Men under my command,
accomplished my task, I am going to England for
the benefit of my health; but I can assure you, and
beg of your Excellency to assure the Grand Signior of the
same, that should the Enemy again send a Naval
force to attack his Dominions, I shall hold myself ready
to come forth again for their destruction.” To the
Caimakan Pacha he says, “It was my orders, in May
1798, to destroy the French Mediterranean fleet. By the
happy capture of the <i>Généreux</i> and <i>William Tell</i>, (the
last on the 30th March,) thanks to the Almighty, and
the bravery of the Officers and Men under my command,
<em>all</em>, <em>all</em>, are taken, burnt, or sunk. Of the thirteen Sail
of the Line, not one remains; and I trust that very
soon the same may be told of their Army, who dared to
land on the Territory of the Sublime Porte. Perish all
the enemies of his Imperial Majesty the Grand Signior!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Having completely obeyed my orders, with great injury
to my health, I am going to England for the benefit of
it.” He adds that he will not fail his ally, should
another French fleet menace the Turkish dominions.
“I shall hold myself ready, if I am thought fit for such
a service, to come forth, and be the instrument of God’s
vengeance on such miscreant infernal scoundrels.” He
writes to Earl Spencer, enclosing Berry’s account of the
capture of the French battleship, and assures himself
that his Lordship “will not be sparing of promotion to
the deserving. My friends wished me to be present.
I have no such wish; for a something might have been
given me, which now cannot. Not for all the world would
I rob any man of a sprig of laurel&mdash;much less my children
of the <i>Foudroyant</i>! I love her as a fond father, a
darling child, and glory in her deeds. I am vain enough
to feel the effects of my school. Lord Keith sending me
nothing, I have not, of course, a free communication.
I have wrote to him for permission to return to England,
when you will see a broken-hearted man.... My complaint,
which is principally a swelling of the heart, is at
times alarming to my friends....” “My mind is
fixed for retreat at this moment,” he informs “fighting
Berry.” “Assure all the Foudroyants of my sincere
regard and affection for them. <em>They may depend upon
me.</em>” “I glory in them, my darling children, served in
my school, and all of us caught our professional zeal and
fire from the great and good Earl of St Vincent”&mdash;thus
he writes to Keith. None of his hundreds of letters more
fully reveals the charming nature of the man, than those
quoted above. While Nelson was fond enough of glory
for himself, he was too large-hearted to deprive others
of it.</p>

<p>We have now to return to his unhappy and miscalculated
transactions with the people whom he served
not wisely but too well, to show him again “a vehement
partisan of the Court of Naples,” as Judge O’Connor
Morris expresses it. “I purpose going in the <i>Foudroyant</i>,”
he tells Keith, on the 12th May, “in a few days, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Palermo, as I am under an old promise to her Sicilian
Majesty, that whenever she returned to the Continent,
I would escort her over. Her Majesty has now made
application to me for that purpose; and, as it may be
necessary to take another Ship for the escort, I purpose
taking the <i>Alexander</i> with me.” It is clear that Nelson
had no right to enter into any such arrangement, especially
as there were too few rather than too many ships
for the blockade of Malta. Before Keith’s despatch was
received forbidding Nelson to use the vessels, the
Admiral had left Malta for Palermo, which he reached
on the 31st May. But he <em>did</em> get a despatch ordering
him to take the ships then at Leghorn to Spezia, which
Nelson only partly obeyed, and stationed himself at the
former port to await the convenience of the Queen and
family. There he was met on the 24th June by his
Commander-in-chief, whose feelings may be gauged by
his letter to the Hon. A. Paget, Sir William Hamilton’s
successor as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary
to the King of the Two Sicilies. It was
written at Leghorn on the 16th July, two days after the
disastrous defeat of the Austrians by Napoleon at
Marengo.</p>

<p>He says: “I was so displeased by the withdrawing of
the Ships from before Malta, and with other proceedings
that Her Majesty did not take any notice of me latterally
which had no effect on my attention to Her Rank, what
a Clamour to letting in the Ships to Malta will occasion
I assure you nothing has given me more real concern it
was so near exhausted.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> “The Paget Papers” make
it quite clear that Queen Caroline did not go out of her
way to impress Keith, but rather exhibited a fondness
for snubbing him. He writes to Paget on another
occasion to the effect that “the Queen expected the
Whole Squadron to attend on Her Court which was
impossible a Riot happened in the Square the Queen
desired I would go to the people, I declined having no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Authority to do so and disapproving of all tumults on
every pretence in short Her Majesty took leave of Every
one in Public but me....” An extremely important
letter<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> will also be found in the same collection of
documents which sheds much light on the personalities
of the Royal folk with whom Nelson had so much to do
in this phase of his career. Paget is writing to Lord
Grenville, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs:</p>

<p>“The King, whose real character has from circumstances
shown itself during and since the revolution
more than at any former period, is timid and bigoted
and, as is often the case in the same disposition, cruel
and revengeful. He has no natural turn for, nor do his
habits allow him to attend to business. He has no
guide for his Conduct but that of private consideration,
and to take the present Instance, whatever plea he may
set forth for delaying his return to Naples, I am in my
own mind convinced, and I should not utter these
opinions but upon the surest grounds, that His
Sicilian Majesty labours under the strongest apprehensions
for his own personal safety.</p>

<p>“The Queen’s character generally is too well known
to Your Lordship to require any comment upon it from
me. I have every reason to suppose that not from
principles but from pique, Her Sicilian Majesty has been
very violent in opposing the King’s return since my
arrival. She had been taught to believe that I was sent
here to Dictate and to use haughty language upon the
Subject, at which idea I know from <em>undoubted authority</em>
she was most violently irritated.... But I have
reason to think that She has entirely lost her Influence,
though she meddles as much as ever in business. She
assists at every Council that is held....</p>

<p>“The King and Queen of Naples are, as I have already
mentioned, upon the worst terms.... His Sicilian
Majesty considers the former intrigues of the Queen as
the principal cause of the misfortunes that have befallen
Him. He has made a solemn vow not to return with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Her to Naples, on which account he is anxious that she
should take this Journey to Vienna.” He adds that
he has been led to suppose that Queen Caroline’s visit
to Vienna “is to endeavour to produce a change in
the disposition of that Court which is thought to be
extremely unfriendly,” and that her Majesty’s uneasiness
was due to a suspicion that the Emperor might be led
to take advantage of the defenceless state of the Sicilian
dominions. In a “Private and Confidential” note to
Grenville of the same date dealing with the intrigues of
Lady Hamilton who, according to Paget, had represented
him as a Jacobin and coxcomb, he mentions
Nelson’s health as “I fear sadly impaired, &amp; I am assured
that his fortune is fallen into the same state in consequence
of great losses which both His Lordship &amp; Lady
Hamilton have sustained at Faro &amp; other Games of
Hazard. They are expected back from Malta every
day, &amp; are then I understand to proceed by Sea to
England.”</p>

<p>The Earl of Dundonald affords us an intimate glimpse
of Nelson at this time in his “Autobiography.” He
was then serving under Keith, and had several conversations
with the great sailor during the visit of the
Commander-in-chief to Palermo. “From one of his
frequent injunctions, ‘Never mind manœuvres, always
go at them,’ I subsequently had reason,” he says, “to
consider myself indebted for successful attacks under
apparently difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>“The impression left on my mind during these opportunities
of association with Nelson was that of his being
an embodiment of dashing courage, which would not
take much trouble to circumvent an enemy, but being
confronted with one would regard victory so much a
matter of course as hardly to deem the chance of defeat
worth consideration.”</p>

<p>Permission for Nelson’s return home, either by land
or sea, was duly granted by the Admiralty. Earl
Spencer took occasion to mildly rebuke the Admiral
in a private letter, stating that in his opinion it appears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
“more advisable for you to come home at once, than
to be obliged to remain inactive at Palermo, while active
service was going on in other parts of the station. I
should still much prefer your remaining to complete
the reduction of Malta, which I flatter myself cannot be
very far distant.” At the time of writing, news of the
capture of the <i>Guillaume Tell</i> had not been received.
After hoping that she might strike to Nelson’s flag, Spencer
adds: “I am quite clear, and I believe I am joined in
opinion by all our friends here, that you will be more
likely to recover your health and strength in England
than in an inactive situation at a Foreign Court, however
pleasing the respect and gratitude shown to you
for your services may be, and no testimonies of respect
and gratitude from that Court to you can be, I am convinced,
too great for the very essential services you have
rendered it.”</p>

<p>Nelson struck his flag on the 11th July, and proceeded
to England by way of Florence, Ancona, Trieste, and
Vienna. The journey was made by land so far as
Ancona, where the Queen, Nelson, Lord and Lady
Hamilton, and Miss Knight were taken on board a
Russian vessel and landed at Trieste on the 2nd August.
The last-mentioned lady, to whom we have been introduced
on a previous page, was intimately acquainted
with her more eminent companions. The journey was
of a very adventurous nature, as the following extracts
from her letters to “fighting Berry,” printed by Nicolas,
will <span class="locked">prove:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“July 16th.&mdash; ... Lord Nelson is going on an
expedition he disapproves, and against his own convictions,
because he has promised the Queen, and that
others advise her. I pity the Queen. Prince Belmonte
directs the march; and Lady Hamilton, though she
does not like him, seconds his proposals, because she
hates the sea, and wishes to visit the different Courts of
Germany. Sir William says <em>he</em> shall die by the way,
and he looks so ill, that I should not be surprised if he
did. I am astonished that the Queen, who is a sensible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
woman,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> should consent to run so great a risk; but I can
assure you, that neither she nor the Princesses forget
their great obligations to you....</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Ancona</span>, <i>24th July</i>, 1800.&mdash;As I find delays succeed
each other, and England still recedes from us, I will not
omit, at least, informing you of our adventures. We left
Leghorn the day after I wrote to you, ... and owing
more to good fortune than to prudence, arrived in
twenty-six hours at Florence, after passing within <em>two
miles</em> of the French advanced posts. After a short stay,
we proceeded on our way to this place. At Castel San
Giovanni, the coach, in which were Lord Nelson, and
Sir William and Lady Hamilton, was overturned; Sir
William and Lady Hamilton were hurt, but not dangerously.
The wheel was repaired, but broke again at
Arezzo&mdash;the Queen two days’ journey before them, and
news of the French Army advancing rapidly, it was
therefore decided that they should proceed, and Mrs
Cadogan<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> and I remain with the broken carriage, as it
was of less consequence we should be left behind, or
taken, than they.... Just as we were going to set off,
we received accounts of the French being very near the
road where we had to pass, and of its being also infested
with Neapolitan deserters; but at the same moment
arrived a party of Austrians, and the Officers gave us
two soldiers as a guard. We travelled night and day;
the roads are almost destroyed, and the misery of the
inhabitants is beyond description. At length, however,
we arrived at Ancona, and found that the Queen had
given up the idea of going in the <i>Bellona</i>, an Austrian
Frigate, fitted up with silk hangings, carpets, and eighty
beds for her reception, and now meant to go with a
Russian Squadron of three Frigates and a Brig. I
believe she judged rightly; for there had been a mutiny
on board the <i>Bellona</i>, and, for the sake of accommodation,
she had reduced her guns to twenty-four, while the
French, in possession of the Coast, arm Trabaccoli, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
other light Vessels, that could easily surround and take
her. This Russian Squadron is commanded by Count
Voinovitsch, a Dalmatian, who having seen his people
ill-treated, and their colours destroyed by the Germans
last year at the Siege of Ancona, made a vow never to
come ashore, and keeps it religiously, for he has not
returned the Queen’s visit.... Lord Nelson talks
often of the <i>Foudroyant</i>, whatever is done to turn off
the conversation; and last night he was talking with
Captain Messer of the manœuvres he intended to make
in case he accepted of another command. In short, I
perceive that his thoughts turn towards England, and I
hope, and believe he will be happy there.... Lord
Nelson has been received with acclamations in all the
towns of the Pope’s States....</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Trieste</span>, <i>9th of August</i>, 1800.&mdash;... I told you we
were become humble enough to rejoice at a Russian
Squadron conveying us across the Adriatic; but had we
sailed, as was first intended, in the Imperial Frigate,
we should have been taken by eight Trabaccoli, which
the French armed on purpose at Pisaro. Sir William
and Lady Hamilton, and Lord Nelson, give a miserable
account of their sufferings on board the Commodore’s
Ship, (Count Voinovitsch).<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> He was ill in his cot; but
his First Lieutenant, a Neapolitan, named Capaci, was,
it seems, the most insolent and ignorant of beings.
Think what Lord Nelson must have felt! He says a
gale of wind would have sunk the Ship.... Poor Sir
William Hamilton has been so ill, that the physicians
had almost given him up: he is now better, and I hope
we shall be able to set off to-morrow night for Vienna.
The Queen and thirty-four of her suite have had fevers:
you can form no idea of the <em>helplessness</em> of the party.
How we shall proceed on our long journey, is to me a
problem; but we shall certainly get on as fast as we can;
for the very precarious state of Sir William’s health has
convinced everybody that it is necessary he should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
arrange his affairs.... Poor Lord Nelson, whose only
comfort was in talking of ships and harbours with
Captain Messer, has had a bad cold; but is almost well,
and, I think, anxious to be in England. He is followed
by thousands when he goes out, and for the illumination
that is to take place this evening, there are many
<em>Viva Nelsons</em>, prepared. He seems affected whenever
he speaks of <em>you</em>, and often sighs out, ‘Where is the
<i>Foudroyant</i>?’”</p>

<p>The party arrived at Vienna in the third week of
August 1800. Nelson became the hero of the hour. He
was entertained in the most sumptuous way. The
composer Haydn played to him while the Admiral&mdash;played
at cards! Nelson was surfeited by attentions
for a month, before proceeding to Prague and Dresden.
The beautiful and clever Mrs St George, who afterwards
changed her name a second time and became Mrs Trench,
and the mother of a celebrated Archbishop of Dublin,
happened to be at the latter Court during the visit, and
she confides to her Diary many interesting little happenings
connected with Nelson and Lady Hamilton. The
picture she paints of Sir William’s wife is by no means
so prepossessing as others, but at a certain dinner she was
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vis-a-vis</i> “with only the Nelson party,” which gives her
a right to speak.</p>

<p>“It is plain,” she writes, “that Lord Nelson thinks of
nothing but Lady Hamilton, who is totally occupied by
the same object. She is bold, forward, coarse, assuming,
and vain. Her figure is colossal, but, excepting her
feet, which are hideous, well-shaped. Her bones are
large, and she is exceedingly <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">embonpoint</i>. She resembles
the bust of Ariadne; the shape of all her features is fine,
as is the form of her head, and particularly her ears;
her teeth are a little irregular, but tolerably white;
her eyes light blue, with a brown spot in one, which,
though a defect, takes nothing away from her beauty
or expression. Her eyebrows and her hair are dark,
and her complexion coarse. Her expression is strongly
marked, variable, and interesting; her movements in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
common life ungraceful; her voice loud, yet not disagreeable.
Lord Nelson is a little man, without any
dignity, who, I suppose, must resemble what Suwarrow
was in his youth, as he is like all the pictures I have
seen of that General. Lady Hamilton takes possession
of him, and he is a willing captive, the most submissive
and devoted I have seen. Sir William is old, infirm,
and all admiration of his wife, and never spoke to-day
but to applaud her. Miss Cornelia Knight seems the
decided flatterer of the two, and never opens her mouth
but to show forth their praise; and Mrs Cadogan, Lady
Hamilton’s mother, is&mdash;what one might expect. After
dinner we had several songs in honour of Nelson, written
by Miss Knight, and sung by Lady Hamilton. She puffs
the incense full in his face, but he receives it with
pleasure, and snuffs it up very cordially.”</p>

<p>In another passage Mrs Trench refers to Lady
Hamilton’s representations of statues and paintings
which Romney painted so delightfully. “She assumes
their attitude, expression, and drapery with great
facility, swiftness, and accuracy.” When she sang she
was frequently out of tune, and her voice had “no
sweetness.” Mrs Trench sums up the character of
her subject as “bold, daring, vain even to folly, and
stamped with the manners of her first situation<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> much
more strongly than one would suppose, after having
represented Majesty, and lived in good company fifteen
years. Her ruling passions seem to me vanity, avarice,
and love for the pleasures of the table. She showed a
great avidity for presents, and has actually obtained
some at Dresden by the common artifice of admiring and
longing.”</p>

<p>It is not a pleasant picture, and is perhaps a little overdrawn,
but even allowing a certain amount of latitude
for the severity of a woman criticising a member of her
sex with whom she has little in common, it must be
confessed that contemporary opinion is very largely on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the side of the young and beautiful widow who thus
confided her opinion so emphatically in the pages of her
private journal.</p>

<p>Hamburg was reached on the 21st of October. Here
Nelson met Dumouriez, the veteran hero of the battle of
Jemappes, and according to Miss Cornelia Knight, “the
two distinguished men took a great fancy to one another....
Dumouriez at that time maintained himself by his
writings, and Lord Nelson forced him to accept a hundred
pounds, telling him he had used his sword too well to live
only by his pen.” Ten days after the arrival of the
party at Hamburg they embarked for England. When
Nelson stepped on shore at Yarmouth on the 6th
November 1800, the crowd which had assembled greeted
him with all the enthusiasm of such gatherings when a
great and popular man is in their midst. Some of the
more boisterous spirits unharnessed the horses of the
carriage awaiting the Admiral and his friends and drew
them to their destination, a certain well-known hostelry
in the town.</p>

<p>Thus England welcomed back the hero of the Nile and
a pillar of the Sicilian Kingdom after an absence of
nearly three years, every day of which had been lived
to the full.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Ostensibly</span> Nelson had come back to England
because of illness. That his health was
improved by the prolonged journey home
via the overland route is quite possible. The relief
from worry as to the Mediterranean in general and
to Keith in particular no doubt conduced largely to
so desirable a result. It is evident that he had returned
to a normal condition of mind and of body;
otherwise we should not find him writing to the Secretary
of the Admiralty on the day of his arrival in England
that his health was “perfectly re-established” and
that he wished “to serve immediately.”</p>

<p>Nelson did not have to wait long for his wishes to
be fulfilled. On the first day of the new year he was
made a Vice-Admiral of the Blue, not as a reward for
his services but in a general promotion. A little over
a fortnight later he hoisted his flag on the <i>San Josef</i>
(112), one of the prizes of the battle off Cape St
Vincent, commanded by the devoted Hardy. Nelson
then made the request, apparently on the principle of
“nothing venture nothing have,” that the Lords of the
Admiralty would not consider his “necessary coming
from Italy as a dereliction of the service, but only a
remove from the Mediterranean to the Channel.”
Although he was a favourite of the rank and file of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
the Navy, he was certainly not esteemed so highly
by “the powers that be.” No doubt he was himself
partly responsible. His friend Collingwood’s “Correspondence”
at the time affords a little sidelight on the
matter. “We are at present lying completely ready,”
he writes on the 25th January, “and, on the least
motion made by the enemy, should sail; so you may
conceive what an anxious time I have of it. Lord
Nelson is here; and I think he will probably come and
live with me when the weather will allow him; but
he does not get in and out of ships well with one arm.
He gave me an account of his reception at Court, which
was not very flattering, after having been the admiration
of that of Naples. His Majesty merely asked
him if he had recovered his health; and then, without
waiting for an answer, turned to General &mdash;&mdash;, and
talked to him near half an hour in great good humour.
It could not be about his successes.”</p>

<p>The early days of the nineteenth century were overshadowed
by a storm-cloud which burst with sudden
fury and dispersed almost as rapidly, giving place to
a short-lived peace followed by twelve years of incessant
tempest. So far back as 1780 Russia, Sweden and
Denmark had entered into a league of Armed Neutrality
by which, in the terse summing-up of Laughton, they
had “bound themselves to resist the right of ‘visit
and search’ claimed by the belligerents, and to enforce
the acceptance of certain principles of so-called international
law; among others, the security of a belligerent’s
property under a neutral flag,&mdash;‘a free ship
makes free goods’; that a blockade to be binding
must be maintained by an adequate force; and that
‘contraband of war’ must be distinctly defined beforehand.
As these principles, if admitted by England,
amounted to the import by France of naval stores,&mdash;masts,
hemp, tar&mdash;from the Baltic, to be paid for
by French exports, the English Government was
resolved to contest them.” From 1793 to 1800 Sweden
and Denmark were neutral, but Great Britain, secure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
in her maritime supremacy, had continued to search
merchant-ships, whether convoyed by a vessel of war
or not. Matters were brought to a crisis by the capture
of the Danish frigate <i>Freya</i> on the 25th July 1800, and
the subsequent passage of the Sound by a British
squadron. At the moment Denmark was not prepared
for hostilities, and entered into a convention
with Great Britain, which admitted the right of search.</p>

<p>When, a little later, the half-crazy Czar, Paul I.,
dissatisfied with England as an ally, and led on by
specious promises on the part of Napoleon, definitely
renewed the League, the two Baltic Powers willingly
joined him. He laid an embargo on all British ships
in Russian ports, and generally showed that it was a
case of “off with the old love and on with the new.”</p>

<p>It was thought in England that negotiations, backed
by a strong fleet, would be sufficient to sever Denmark
from the alliance. With this object in view fifteen
sail-of-the-line<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> having a considerable number of soldiers
on board for use if necessary, and attended by a collection
of smaller vessels, sailed early in March. When
Nelson heard of Sir Hyde Parker’s appointment as
Commander-in-chief, he was no more pleased than
when Keith had returned to his former station in the
previous year, but he wisely smothered his disappointment.
His “sole object,” he informs Lord St Vincent,
“and to which all my exertions and abilities tend, is
to bring this long war to an honourable termination;
to accomplish which, we must all pull in the collar,
and, as we have got such a driver who will make the
lazy ones pull as much as the willing, I doubt not but
we shall get safely, speedily, and honourably to our
journey’s end.” This is Nelson at his best, the Nelson
who could sacrifice himself for King and Country. It
was not until the 17th February that he received
definite instructions to “put himself under the command”
of Parker. Shortly afterwards he changed
his ship for the <i>St George</i> (98). “The <i>St George</i> will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
stamp an additional ray of glory to England’s fame,
if Nelson survives;” he writes to Lady Hamilton, “and
that Almighty Providence, who has hitherto protected
me in all dangers, and covered my head in the day of
battle, will still, if it be his pleasure, support and assist
me.” To his old friend Berry he says, “I hope we
shall be able as usual to get so close to our Enemies
that our shot cannot miss their object, and that we
shall again give our Northern Enemies that hail-storm
of bullets which is so emphatically described in the
‘Naval Chronicle,’ and which gives our dear Country
the Dominion of the Seas. We have it, and all the
Devils in Hell cannot take it from us, if our Wooden
walls have fair play.” As this letter was penned on
the 9th March, before the armament left Yarmouth,
it is clear that the Admiral did not set much store
by the proposed negotiations, for which purpose Mr
Vansittart,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> reputed to be a skilful diplomatist, sailed
with the fleet when it weighed anchor three days later.</p>

<p>The first general rendezvous was the Skaw, which
was made on the 19th. A period of heavy weather&mdash;bad
winds, sleet, snow, frost, and rain&mdash;had set in.
Believers in omens not unnaturally predicted the ill-success
of the expedition, which was intensified by the
loss of the <i>Invincible</i> (74) with some 400 souls. She
struck a sandbank, floated off into deep water, and
then went down. Nelson’s own ship was not in the
best of condition; she was both leaky and uncomfortable.
However, a vessel is but a means to an end,
and so long as the <i>St George</i> could float and her men
could fire a broadside Nelson was content. In his
eager, passionate way, the Admiral strongly disapproved
of what he had been able to ascertain of Parker’s plans:
“honour may arise from them, good cannot. I hear
we are likely to anchor outside Cronenburg Castle,
instead of Copenhagen, which would give weight to
our negotiation: a Danish Minister would think twice
before he would put his name to war with England,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
when the next moment he would probably see his
Master’s Fleet in flames, and his Capital in ruins; but
‘out of sight out of mind,’ is an old saying. The Dane
should see our Flag waving every moment he lifted
up his head.”</p>

<p>A council of war was held on the 23rd. On the
following day Nelson wrote a lengthy letter to the
Commander-in-chief detailing his opinion of what
should be done, Vansittart’s latest report being to the
effect that the Danish Government was hostile “in the
greatest possible degree.” He urged that not a moment
should be lost in attacking the enemy. He brings all
the persuasiveness of which he was capable to bear on
Parker. “Here you are,” he says, “with almost the
safety, certainly with the honour of England more
intrusted to you, than ever yet fell to the lot of any
British Officer.” This is exaggerating somewhat, but
doubtless the writer felt deeply the urgency of the
matter. “On your decision depends,” he adds with
nearer approach to truth, “whether our Country shall
be degraded in the eyes of Europe, or whether she
shall rear her head higher than ever: again do I repeat,
never did our Country depend so much on the success
of any Fleet as on this.” He then proceeds to sketch
a plan of campaign, starting with the supposition that
the fleet enters by the Passage of the Sound. He
allows for a certain amount of damage “amongst our
masts and yards” taking place before Cronenburg
is reached. There the ships and Crown Island are
attacked, “Ships crippled, and perhaps one or two
lost.” This mode Nelson calls “taking the bull by
the horns,” and does not prevent the ships from Revel,
or the Swedish squadron, from joining their allies.
He therefore proposes passing Cronenburg, “taking the
risk of damage,” to “pass up the deepest and straightest
Channel above the Middle Grounds; and coming down
the Garbar or King’s Channel, to attack their Floating
batteries, &amp;c., &amp;c., as we find it convenient. It must
have the effect of preventing a junction between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Russians, Swedes, and Danes, and may give us an
opportunity of bombarding Copenhagen.” He also
suggests a passage to the northward of Southolm. An
alternative mode of attack is by the passage of the
Belt, an attack on Draco, thus preventing the junction
of the Russians, and “with every probability of success
against the Danish Floating batteries.” His concluding
words are in the true Nelson spirit: “Supposing us
through the Belt with the wind first westerly, would
it not be possible to either go with the Fleet, or detach
ten Ships of three and two decks, with one Bomb and
two Fire-Ships, to Revel, to destroy the Russian
Squadron at that place? I do not see the great risk
of such a detachment, and with the remainder to
attempt the business at Copenhagen. The measure
may be thought bold, but I am of opinion the boldest
measures are the safest; and our Country demands
a most vigorous exertion of her force, directed with
judgment.” Nelson concludes with the assurance that
“no exertion of head or heart” shall be wanting on
his part.</p>

<p>The proposed terms were definitely refused by Denmark,
but Nelson’s “bold measure” of detaching part
of the British fleet to attack the Russian squadron
at Revel while the other attacked the Capital did
not appeal to the unimaginative Parker. Copenhagen
must first be overcome. The pilots also assured the
Commander-in-chief that the passage of the Belt was
the safest, which drew from Nelson the abrupt but
thoroughly characteristic reply, “Let it be by the
Sound, by the Belt, or any how, only lose not an
hour!” Eventually the Sound was chosen.</p>

<p>Having shifted his flag from the <i>St George</i> to the
<i>Elephant</i> (74), a more serviceable ship for the difficult
passage, the British fleet, in order of battle, slowly
threaded its way through the shoals on the 30th March,
Nelson commanding the van, Parker the centre, and
Graves the rear. The guns of Cronenburg Castle,
dominating the Sound, blazed away, as did those on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the armed hulks with which the Danes had hoped to
defend the narrow channel, but the Swedish guns
maintained a stolid silence. The fleet then anchored
a few miles below Copenhagen. Parker, Nelson, and
several other officers boarded a lugger to reconnoitre
the enemy’s defences. Various soundings were made
to the accompaniment of gun-firing, and it was found
that the enemy had placed a formidable flotilla, including
two 70-gun ships, a frigate, and two dismasted 64-gun
ships, in the front of the harbour and arsenal. The
Trekroner Battery had also been strengthened. A
second council of war was held on the 31st, some interesting
particulars of which are furnished by Colonel
William Stewart, who was in command of some of the
troops. After some difficulties had been stated anent
“the three Powers we should either have to engage, in
succession or united, in those seas,” Stewart tells us
that “Lord Nelson kept pacing the cabin, mortified
at everything that savoured either of alarm or irresolution.
When the above remark was applied to the
Swedes, he sharply observed, ‘The more numerous
the better’; and when to the Russians, he repeatedly
said, ‘So much the better, I wish they were twice as
many, the easier the victory, depend on it.’”</p>

<p>“At the battle of Copenhagen,” writes Mr Ferguson,
surgeon of the <i>Elephant</i>, “I was amongst the companions
of the hero. The attempt was arduous in
the extreme: no common mind would have dared to
conceive it; but it was suited to the exalted enterprise
of Lord Nelson. As <em>his</em> was the invigorating
spirit of the council that planned the attack, so in the
execution <em>he</em> only could have commanded success.
During the interval that preceded the battle, I could
only silently admire when I saw the first man in all the
world spend the hours of the day and night in boats,
amid floating ice, and in the severest weather; and
wonder when the light shewed me a path marked
by buoys, which had been trackless the preceding
evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
“On the first day of April, in the afternoon, we took
our departure with twelve sail-of-the-line, and a proportionate
number of smaller vessels, from the main
body of the fleet, then lying about four miles below
Copenhagen; and coasted along the outer edge of the
shoal called the middle ground, until we doubled its
farthest extremities, when the fleet cast anchor. This
shoal, of the same extent as the sea front of the town,
lies exactly before it, at about three-quarters of a mile
in distance; the interval between it and the shore had
deep water, and is called the King’s Channel.</p>

<p>“In this channel the Danes had arranged their
defence, as near the town as possible. It consisted of
nineteen ships and floating batteries, flanked at the
town’s extremity by two artificial islands at the mouth
of the harbour, called the Crown batteries, and extending
for a mile along the whole front of the town, leaving
intervals for the batteries on shore to play.</p>

<p>“As our anchor dropped at eight in the evening,
Nelson emphatically called out, ‘I will fight them
the moment I have a fair wind.’ He spent the whole
night in consultation.</p>

<p>“About half-past nine a.m. of the 2nd of April, the
signals of the different ships having been made, repeated,
and answered, we had the mortification to see
the <i>Agamemnon</i> get upon the shoal on the first attempt
to leave her anchorage, where she remained immovable.
A similar misfortune followed in succession to the
<i>Russell</i> and <i>Polyphemus</i>; and in addition to all this,
the <i>Jamaica</i> frigate, with a convoy of gunboats and
the small craft having fallen in with the counter current,
and being unable to stem it, made the signal of inability
to proceed. A mind less invincible than Nelson’s
might have been discouraged: though the battle had
not commenced, yet he had approached the enemy;
and he felt that he could not retreat or wait for reinforcements,
without compromising the glory of his
country. The signal to bear down was still kept flying.
His agitation during these moments was extreme; I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
shall never forget the impression it made on me. It
was not, however, the agitation of indecision, but of
ardent animated patriotism, panting for glory, which
had appeared within his reach, and was vanishing from
his grasp.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Admiral Mahan</span>, the most scientific of biographical
historians, assures us that the fullest
and most interesting account of the Battle of
Copenhagen is that of Colonel William Stewart, an
eye-witness of the thrilling scene and “a very fine
gallant man” according to Nelson. The following
particulars are therefore extracted from his graphic
narrative:</p>

<p>“The Action began at five minutes past ten. In
about half an hour afterwards, the first half of our Fleet
was engaged, and before half-past eleven, the Battle
became general. The <i>Elephant’s</i> station was in the
centre, opposite to the Danish Commodore.... The
judgment with which each Ship calculated her station
in that intricate Channel, was admirable throughout.
The failure of the three Ships that were aground, and
whose force was to have been opposed to the Trekroner
battery, left this day, as glorious for seamanship as for
courage, incomplete.... The gallant Riou, perceiving
the blank in the original plan for the attack of the
Crown Battery, proceeded down the Line with his
Squadron of Frigates, and attempted, but in vain, to
fulfil the duty of the absent Ships of the Line. His
force was unequal to it; and the general signal of recall,
which was made about mid-action by the Commander-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>in-Chief,
had the good effect of, at least, saving Riou’s
Squadron from destruction.</p>

<p>“About one <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, few if any of the Enemy’s heavy
Ships and Praams had ceased to fire. The <i>Isis</i> had
greatly suffered by the superior weight of the <i>Provestein’s</i>
fire; and if it had not been for the judicious diversion
of it by the <i>Desirée</i>, Captain Inman, who raked her, and
for other assistance from the <i>Polyphemus</i>, the <i>Isis</i> would
have been destroyed. Both the <i>Isis</i> and <i>Bellona</i> had
received serious injury by the bursting of some of their
guns. The <i>Monarch</i> was also suffering severely under
the united fire of the <i>Holstein</i> and <i>Zealand</i>; and only
two of our Bomb-vessels could get to their station on
the Middle Ground, and open their mortars on the
Arsenal, directing their shells over both Fleets. Our
Squadron of Gun-brigs, impeded by currents, could not,
with the exception of one, although commanded by
Captain Rose in the <i>Jamaica</i>, weather the eastern end
of the Middle Ground, or come into Action. The Division
of the Commander-in-chief acted according to the
preconcerted plan; but could only menace the entrance
of the Harbour. The <i>Elephant</i> was warmly engaged by
the <i>Dannebrog</i>, and by two heavy Praams on her bow
and quarter. Signals of distress were on board the
<i>Bellona</i> and <i>Russell</i>, and of inability from the <i>Agamemnon</i>.
The contest, in general, although from the relaxed state
of the Enemy’s fire, it might not have given much room
for apprehension as to the result, had certainly, at one
<span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, not declared itself in favour of either side. About
this juncture, and in this posture of affairs, the signal
was thrown out on board the <i>London</i>,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> for the Action
to cease.</p>

<div id="ip_172" class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">

  <div class="caption"><p>“I really do not see the signal”</p>

<p class="notbold">Stephen Reid</p></div></div>

<p>“Lord Nelson was at this time, as he had been during
the whole Action, walking the starboard side of the
quarter-deck; sometimes much animated, and at others
heroically fine in his observations. A shot through the
mainmast knocked a few splinters about us. He
observed to me, with a smile, ‘It is warm work, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
this day may be the last to any of us at a moment’;
and then stopping short at the gangway, he used an
expression never to be erased from my memory, and
said with emotion, ‘but mark you, I would not be
elsewhere for thousands.’ When the signal, No. 39,
[to discontinue the engagement], was made, the Signal
Lieutenant reported it to him. He continued his walk,
and did not appear to take notice of it. The Lieutenant
meeting his Lordship at the next turn asked, ‘whether
he should repeat it?’ Lord Nelson answered, ‘No,
acknowledge it.’ On the Officer returning to the poop,
his Lordship called after him, ‘Is No. 16 [for close
action] still hoisted?’ the Lieutenant answering in the
affirmative, Lord Nelson said, ‘Mind you keep it so.’
He now walked the deck considerably agitated, which
was always known by his moving the stump of his right
arm. After a turn or two, he said to me, in a quick
manner, ‘Do you know what’s shown on board of the
Commander-in-chief, No. 39?’ On asking him what
that meant, he answered, ‘Why, to leave off Action.’
‘Leave off Action!’ he repeated, and then added,
with a shrug, ‘Now, &mdash;&mdash; me if I do.’ He also observed,
I believe, to Captain Foley, ‘You know, Foley, I have
only one eye&mdash;I have a right to be blind sometimes’;
and then with an archness peculiar to his character,
putting the glass to his blind eye, he exclaimed, ‘I
really do not see the signal.’<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> This remarkable signal
was, therefore, only acknowledged on board the <i>Elephant</i>,
not repeated. Admiral Graves did the latter, not being
able to distinguish the <i>Elephant’s</i> conduct: either by a
fortunate accident, or intentionally, No. 16 was not
displaced. The Squadron of Frigates obeyed the
signal, and hauled off. That brave Officer, Captain
Riou, was killed by a raking shot, when the <i>Amazon</i>
showed her stern to the Trekroner. He was sitting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
on a gun, was encouraging his men, and had been
wounded in the head by a splinter. He had expressed
himself grieved at being thus obliged to retreat, and
nobly observed, ‘What will Nelson think of us?’
His Clerk was killed by his side; and by another shot,
several of the Marines, while hauling on the main-brace,
shared the same fate. Riou then exclaimed, ‘Come
then, my boys, let us die all together!’ The words were
scarcely uttered, when the fatal shot severed him in
two. Thus, and in an instant, was the British service
deprived of one of its greatest ornaments, and society
of a character of singular worth, resembling the heroes
of romance.</p>

<p>“The Action now continued with unabated vigour.
About two <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, the greater part of the Danish Line
had ceased to fire: some of the lighter Ships were adrift,
and the carnage on board of the Enemy, who reinforced
their crews from the Shore, was dreadful. The taking
possession of such Ships as had struck, was, however,
attended with difficulty; partly by reason of the
batteries on Amak Island protecting them, and partly
because an irregular fire was made on our Boats, as
they approached, from the Ships themselves. The
<i>Dannebrog</i> acted in this manner, and fired at our boat,
although that Ship was not only on fire and had struck,
but the Commodore, Fischer, had removed his Pendant,
and had deserted her. A renewed attack on her by
the <i>Elephant</i> and <i>Glatton</i>, for a quarter of an hour, not
only completely silenced and disabled the <i>Dannebrog</i>,
but, by the use of grape, nearly killed every man who was
in the Praams, ahead and astern of that unfortunate
Ship. On our smoke clearing away, the <i>Dannebrog</i>
was found to be drifting in flames before the wind,
spreading terror throughout the Enemy’s Line. The
usual lamentable scene then ensued; and our Boats
rowed in every direction, to save the crew, who were
throwing themselves from her at every port-hole; few,
however, were left unwounded in her after our last
broadsides, or could be saved. She drifted to leeward,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
and about half-past three blew up. The time of half-past
two, brings me to a most important part of Lord
Nelson’s conduct on this day, and about which so much
discussion has arisen: his sending a Flag of Truce on
shore. To the best of my recollection, the facts were as
follow. After the <i>Dannebrog</i> was adrift, and had
ceased to fire, the Action was found to be over, along
the whole of the Line astern of us; but not so with the
Ships ahead and with the Crown batteries. Whether
from ignorance of the custom of war, or from confusion
on board the Prizes, our Boats were, as before mentioned,
repulsed from the Ships themselves, or fired at from
Amak Island. Lord Nelson naturally lost temper at
this, and observed, ‘That he must either send on shore,
and stop this irregular proceeding, or send in our Fire-ships
and burn them.’ He accordingly retired into the
stern gallery, and wrote, with great dispatch, that well-known
Letter addressed to the Crown Prince,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> with the
address, ‘To the Brothers of Englishmen, the brave
Danes, &amp;c.’:<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> and this Letter was conveyed on shore
through the contending Fleets by Captain Sir Frederick
Thesiger, who acted as his Lordship’s Aid-de-camp; and
found the Prince near the Sally-port, animating his
people in a spirited manner.</p>

<p>“Whether we were actually firing at that time in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
<i>Elephant</i> or not, I am unable to recollect; it could only
have been partially, at such of the farther Ships as had
not struck. The three Ships ahead of us were, however,
engaged; and from the superiority of the force opposed
to them, it was by no means improbable that Lord
Nelson’s observing eye pointed out to him the expediency
of a prudent conduct. Whether this suggested to him
the policy of a Flag of Truce or not, two solid reasons
were apparent, and were such as to justify the measure:
viz., the necessity of stopping the irregular fire from the
Ships which had surrendered&mdash;and the singular opportunity
that was thus given, of sounding the feelings of
an Enemy, who had reluctantly entered into the war,
and who must feel the generosity of the first offer of
amity coming from a conquering foe. If there were a
third reason for the conduct of the noble Admiral, and
some of his own Officers assert this, it was unnecessary
that it should have been expressed; it was certainly not
avowed, and will for ever remain a matter of conjecture.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
While the Boat was absent, the animated fire
of the Ships ahead of us, and the approach of two of
the Commander-in-chief’s division, the <i>Ramilies</i> and
<i>Defence</i>, caused the remainder of the Enemy’s Line to
the eastward of the Trekroner to strike: that formidable
Work continued its fire, but fortunately at too long
a range to do serious damage to any one except the
<i>Monarch</i>, whose loss in men, this day, exceeded that of
any Line-of-Battle Ship during the war. From the
uninjured state of this Outwork, which had been manned
at the close of the Action with nearly 1500 men, it was
deemed impracticable to carry into execution the projected
plan for storming it; the Boats for this service
had been on the starboard side of each Ship during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Action. The firing from the Crown Battery and from
our leading Ships did not cease until past three o’clock,
when the Danish Adjutant-General, Lindholm, returning
with a Flag of Truce, directed the fire of the battery
to be suspended. The signal for doing the same, on
our part, was then made from our Ship to those engaged.
The Action closed after five hours’ duration, four of
which were warmly contested.</p>

<p>“The answer from the Prince Regent was to inquire
more minutely into the purport of the message. I
should here observe, that previous to the Boat’s getting
on board, Lord Nelson had taken the opinion of his
valuable friends, Fremantle and Foley, the former of
whom had been sent for from the <i>Ganges</i>, as to the
practicability of advancing with the Ships which were
least damaged, upon that part of the Danish Line of
Defence yet uninjured. Their opinions were averse
from it; and, on the other hand, decided in favour of
removing our Fleet, whilst the wind yet held fair, from
their present intricate Channel. Lord Nelson was now
prepared how to act when Mr Lindholm came on board,
and the following answer was returned to the Crown
Prince by Captain Sir Frederick Thesiger: ‘Lord
Nelson’s object in sending the Flag of Truce was
humanity’; etc.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> His Lordship, having finished this
letter, referred the Adjutant-General to the Commander-in-chief,
who was at anchor at least four miles off, for
a conference on the important points which the latter
portion of the message had alluded to; and to this
General Lindholm did not object, but proceeded to the
<i>London</i>. Lord Nelson wisely foresaw, that, exclusive
of the valuable opportunity that now offered itself
for a renewal of Peace, time would be gained by this
long row out to sea, for our leading Ships, which were
much crippled, to clear the shoals, and whose course
was under the immediate fire of the Trekroner. The
Adjutant-General was no sooner gone to the <i>London</i>,
and Captain Thesiger despatched on shore than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
signal was made for the <i>Glatton</i>, <i>Elephant</i>, <i>Ganges</i>,
<i>Defiance</i>, and <i>Monarch</i>, to weigh in succession. The
intricacy of the Channel now showed the great utility
of what had been done; the <i>Monarch</i>, as first Ship,
immediately hit on a shoal, but was pushed over it by
the <i>Ganges</i> taking her amid-ships. The <i>Glatton</i> went
clear, but the <i>Defiance</i> and <i>Elephant</i> ran aground, leaving
the Crown Battery at a mile distance; and there they
remained fixed, the former until ten o’clock that night,
and the latter until night, notwithstanding every exertion
which their fatigued crews could make to relieve
them. Had there been no cessation of hostilities, their
situation would certainly have been perilous; but it
should be observed, on the other hand, that measures
would in that case have been adopted, and they were
within our power, for destroying this formidable Work.</p>

<p>“The <i>Elephant</i> being aground, Lord Nelson followed
the Adjutant-General, about four o’clock, to the <i>London</i>,
where that negotiation first began, which terminated in
an honourable Peace. He was low in spirits at the
surrounding scene of devastation, and particularly felt
for the blowing up of the <i>Dannebrog</i>. ‘Well!’ he exclaimed,
‘I have fought contrary to orders, and I shall
perhaps be hanged: never mind, let them.’ Lindholm
returned to Copenhagen the same evening, when it was
agreed that all Prizes should be surrendered, and the
suspension of hostilities continue for twenty-four hours;
the whole of the Danish wounded were to be received
on shore. Lord Nelson then repaired on board the <i>St
George</i>, and the night was actively passed by the Boats
of the Division which had not been engaged, in getting
afloat the Ships that were ashore, and in bringing out
the Prizes. The <i>Desirée</i> frigate, towards the close of
the Action, going to the aid of the <i>Bellona</i>, became fast
on the same shoal; but neither these Ships, nor the
<i>Russell</i>, were in any danger from the Enemy’s batteries,
as the world has frequently since been led to suppose.”</p>

<p>In sending a copy of Nelson’s Report to the Admiralty,
Sir Hyde Parker paid a worthy tribute to the conduct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
of his second-in-command and of his “entire acquiescence
and testimony of the bravery and intrepidity with
which the Action was supported throughout the Line.
Was it possible,” he continues, “for me to add anything
to the well-earned renown of Lord Nelson, it would
be by asserting, that his exertions, great as they have
heretofore been, never were carried to a higher pitch
of zeal for his Country’s service.</p>

<p>“I have only to lament that the sort of attack,
confined within an intricate and narrow passage, excluded
the Ships particularly under my command from
the opportunity of exhibiting their valour; but I can
with great truth assert, that the same spirit and zeal
animated the whole of the Fleet; and I trust that
the contest in which we were engaged, will on some
future day afford them an occasion of showing that
the whole were inspired with the same spirit, had the
field been sufficiently extensive to have brought it into
action.”</p>

<p>Sentiments so ably expressed are delightful reading.
Nelson, if less dignified in his language, never failed to
show his warm appreciation of those who worked under
him. Caring little for literary form, he invariably
blurted out the naked truth. His despatches were
marked by the same forcible characteristics exhibited
in his conduct when engaging the enemy. “The spirit
and zeal of the Navy,” he tells a correspondent who
had congratulated him on the victory, “I never saw
higher than in this Fleet, and if England is true to herself,
she may bid defiance to Europe. The French have
always, in ridicule, called us a Nation of shopkeepers&mdash;<em>so</em>,
I hope, we shall always remain, and, like other shopkeepers,
if our goods are better than those of any other
Country, and we can afford to sell them cheaper, we
must depend on our shop being well resorted to.”</p>

<p>An armistice for a term of fourteen weeks was agreed
upon on the 9th April 1801. This period would allow
Nelson to settle with the Russian fleet and return to
Copenhagen, as he himself bluntly admitted during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
negotiations. Unused to such “straight talk” in diplomatic
overtures, one of the Danish Commissioners began
to speak of a renewal of hostilities. It merely added
fuel to Nelson’s fire, and drew from him the comment,
made to one of his friends who was standing near,
“Renew hostilities! Tell him we are ready at a moment;
ready to bombard this very night.” The remark was
quite sufficient to silence the man who talked thus
lightly of war.</p>

<p>An opportunity to teach the Russians a lesson did not
come in Nelson’s way. Scarcely more than a week
passed from the time the signatures had dried on the
parchment when to Parker was sent news of the murder of
Paul I. With the death of the monarch Russian policy
underwent a complete change so far as Great Britain
was concerned. The castles in the air for the overthrow
of the British rule in India, which the Czar and Napoleon
had hoped to place on solid foundations, melted away
as mist before the sun. Paul’s successor, Alexander I.,
knowing full well the enormous importance of the
British market for Russian goods, lost no time in coming
to terms with England. Shortly afterwards Sweden,
Denmark, and Prussia followed his example. The
much-boasted Maritime Confederacy was quietly relegated
to the limbo of defeated schemes for the downfall
of the great Sea Power.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir Hyde Parker had been recalled from the
Baltic, and had placed his command in the hands of
Nelson on the 5th May. The latter proceeded from
Kiöge Bay, his station since the birth of amicable
arrangements with the Danes, to Revel, where he hoped
to meet the Russian squadron he had been so anxious
to annihilate before the battle of Copenhagen.</p>

<p>“My object was to get to Revel before the frost broke
up at Cronstadt, that the twelve Sail of the Line might
be destroyed,” he writes to Addington, Pitt’s successor
as Prime Minister, on the 5th May. “I shall now go
there as a friend, but the two Fleets shall not form a
junction, if not already accomplished, unless my orders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
permit it.” “My little trip into the Gulf of Finland,”
he tells Lord St Vincent, “will be, I trust, of National
benefit, and I shall be kind or otherwise, as I find the
folks.” Revel harbour was bare when he entered it,
the squadron having sailed for Cronstadt a few days
before. However, on the 17th May, he was able to inform
Vansittart, “I left Revel this morning where
everybody has been kind to us.” He eventually returned
to Kiöge Bay, where he remained until he was relieved
at his own request owing to ill-health. “I have been
even at <em>Death’s</em> door, apparently in a consumption,”
he tells Ball, probably with a touch of exaggeration.
On the 19th June he set sail in a brig for home, arriving
at Yarmouth on the first day of the following month.
His last act before he quitted the fleet was to congratulate
the men on the work they had accomplished; his first
act when he stepped on shore was to visit the hospitals
to which the wounded had been conveyed after the battle
of Copenhagen. As for his own reward, the King had
seen fit to create him Viscount Nelson of the Nile and
Burnham Thorpe.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">However</span> much Nelson may have appreciated
the visits to London, Box Hill, and Staines,
which he now made in the company of Sir
William and Lady Hamilton, it was soon evident that
his stay on shore would be short. No home ties were
severed when he was appointed to a special service
on the 24th July 1801, for he had finally separated
from his wife six months before. It was a mistaken
match in every way. Although it is often said that
people of opposite temperaments make the best partners
in marriage, it certainly was not so in the case of Nelson
and Mrs Nisbet. Some of the reasons for the unhappiness
of both have been given in a previous chapter,
the prime cause was Lady Hamilton, for whom Nelson
continued to entertain a mad infatuation until the
day he died. Quite naturally and legitimately Lady
Nelson resented the conduct of her husband. Any
woman would have done the same. Angry words
were spoken on both sides, leading to the final and
irrevocable breach, but it is characteristic of Nelson’s
generous nature that on their last interview he said:
“I call God to witness there is nothing in you or your
conduct I wish otherwise.” He was no less generous
in the allowance which he made to her.</p>

<p>For some months Napoleon had been intent on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
building of a flotilla for the invasion of England. All
manner of wild rumours had spread throughout the
country as to the imminent peril of the United Kingdom,
but we now know that the First Consul’s scheme was
comparatively insignificant when compared to his
enormous ship-building programme of 1803&ndash;5 for the
same purpose.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Indeed, a month before Lord St Vincent,
then First Lord of the Admiralty, communicated to
Admiral Lutwidge, the Commander-in-chief in the
Downs, that his command would be impinged upon to
some extent by Nelson’s new post, and that the enemy’s
preparations were “beginning to wear a very serious
appearance,” Napoleon had already postponed his
plan. This is made abundantly clear by the First
Consul’s order of the 23rd June to Augereau, in command
of the Army of Batavia: “You will receive
instructions for the formation at Flushing of five
divisions of gunboats, which, added to the sixteen
divisions in Channel ports, will impose on England.”
Napoleon perfectly understood that the moment for
“leaping the ditch” had not yet arrived. Of the
Navy proper at the beginning of 1801 Great Britain
had no fewer than 127 sail-of-the-line in commission;
France had forty-nine, many in an almost unseaworthy
condition. The Admiralty was not to know of the
letter to Augereau or of the exact state of the French
marine. Boulogne, Calais, and Dunkirk, the ports
of concentration, sheltered some 150 boats of various
descriptions for the purpose of the projected expedition,
and England could afford to run no risks.</p>

<p>Nelson’s command extended from Orfordness, in
Suffolk, to Beachy Head, in Sussex. The specific
purpose of his squadron was to defend the mouths of
the Thames and Medway, and of the coasts of Sussex,
Kent, and Essex. He speedily grasped the situation,
and surmising that London <em>ought</em> to be the enemy’s
object, informed the Admiralty that not only should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
“A great number of Deal and Dover Boats” be available
off Boulogne to “give notice of the direction
taken by the enemy,” but that gunboats and flat boats
should be kept near Margate and Ramsgate,
between Orfordness and the North Foreland, and in
Hollesley Bay, these to be aided by floating batteries.
“If it is calm when the Enemy row out, all our Vessels
and Boats appointed to watch them, must get into the
Channel, and meet them as soon as possible: if not
strong enough for the attack, they must watch, and
keep them company till a favourable opportunity
offers. If a breeze springs up,” he goes on, “our Ships
are to deal <em>destruction</em>; no delicacy can be observed
on this great occasion. But should it remain calm,
and our Flotilla not fancy itself strong enough to attack
the Enemy on their passage, the moment that they
begin to touch our shore, strong or weak, our Flotilla
of Boats must attack as much of the Enemy’s Flotilla
as they are able&mdash;say only one half or two-thirds; it
will create a most powerful diversion, for the bows of
our Flotilla will be opposed to their unarmed sterns,
and the courage of Britons will never, I believe, allow
one Frenchman to leave the Beach.” When the enemy
comes in sight the various divisions of the flotilla “are
to unite, but not intermix.” “<em>Never fear the event.</em>”
These notions, embodied in a lengthy Memorandum
to the Admiralty, are remarkable because Nelson
prophesies “a powerful diversion by the sailing of the
Combined Fleet,” a plan developed by Napoleon in the
later phase of his gigantic preparations for the invasion
of our country. Whatever may have been in his mind
in 1801 regarding this scheme he certainly did not
confide to any of his admirals or military commanders.</p>

<p>Nelson hoisted his flag on the <i>Unité</i> frigate at Sheerness
on the 27th July. Additional evidence of the
humorous turn of his mind is afforded in a note bearing
the same date addressed to Lady Hamilton. “To-day,”
he writes, “I dined with Admiral Græme, who has
also lost his right arm, and as the Commander of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Troops has lost his leg, I expect we shall be caricatured
as the <em>lame</em> defenders of England.” Most people who
have the misfortune to lose a limb are inclined to resent
any reference to the fact on the part of another and
to rigidly ignore the misfortune in their own remarks,
but Nelson rather gloried in his dismembered state
than otherwise. It was visible proof of his service to
his country.</p>

<p>Lord St Vincent did not altogether agree with Nelson’s
plans. In his opinion, “Our great reliance is on the
vigilance and activity of our cruisers at sea.” When
Nelson urged upon the Sea Fencibles<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> to man the coast-defence
vessels he was speedily disillusioned. Of the
2600 men enrolled on that part of the coast under his
jurisdiction only 385 offered themselves for active
service. However, he determined to do his best with
the raw material at hand, and went so far as to tell
the First Lord of the Admiralty that: “Our force will,
by your great exertions, soon get so formidable, that
the Enemy will hardly venture out.” A week after
he had assumed command, he says: “It is perfectly
right to be prepared against a mad Government; but
with the active force your Lordship has given me,
I may pronounce it almost impracticable.”</p>

<p>On the 2nd August Nelson was off the coast of France,
“looking at Boulogne,” and observed the soldiers
erecting guns and mortars “as if fearful of an attack.”
Forty-eight hours later a number of bomb-vessels were
anchored abreast of the port, and the shipping was
fired on without much loss on either side, although
several French gunboats were destroyed. He himself
admitted: “The whole of this business is of no further
moment than to show the Enemy, that, with impunity,
they cannot come outside their Ports. I see nothing
but a desire on the part of our Officers and men to get
at them.” A vast crowd of people collected on the
cliffs at Dover and watched the spectacle. The <i>Moniteur</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the official organ of the French Government, reported
the occurrence as follows:</p>

<p>“At dawn Nelson with thirty vessels of all sizes
appeared before Boulogne. A division of our flotilla
was at anchor slightly in front of the harbour. Their
bomb-ketches opened fire and ours returned it. Several
times the enemy’s line tried to advance and our soldiers
asked to be allowed to board, but the flotilla’s fire
prevented the forward movement and ultimately compelled
the enemy to retire. Nine hundred bombs were
fired during the day without killing or wounding any
one. Two gun-sloops were slightly damaged but returned
to service without loss of time.... This is
the first fight in sight of <em>both</em> shores.” Nelson reported
that three of the flat-bottom boats and a brig were sunk,
and that six went on shore “evidently much damaged,”
of which five were eventually salved. A captain of
the Royal Artillery and three British seamen were
wounded.</p>

<p>Having had the opportunity to see the preparations
of the enemy Nelson was inclined to believe that
Napoleon really meant business. “There can be no
doubt of the intention of the French to attempt the
Invasion of our Country,” he tells four of the captains
under his command. “I have now more than ever
reason to believe,” he confides to Lord St Vincent,
“that the Ports of Flushing and Flanders are much
more likely places to embark men from, than Calais,
Boulogne, or Dieppe; for in Flanders we cannot tell
by our eyes what means they have collected for carrying
an Army.” “My Flotilla, I hope, will be finished
by Wednesday,” he writes to the worthy Sea Lord,
under date of the 7th August, “and I am vain enough
to expect a great deal of mischief to the Enemy from
it. I am sure that the French are trying to get from
Boulogne; yet the least wind at W.N.W. and they
are lost. I pronounce that no embarkation can take
place at Boulogne; whenever it comes forth, it will be
from Flanders, and what a forlorn undertaking! consider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
cross tides, etc., etc. As for rowing, that is
impossible.” This communication was shortly followed
by another: “We are so prepared at this moment, on
the Enemy’s Coasts, that I do not believe they could
get three miles from their own shore.” Again, “Our
active force is perfect, and possesses so much zeal,
that I only wish to catch that Buonaparte on the water,
either with the <i>Amazon</i> or <i>Medusa</i>; but himself he
will never trust.” The Admiral was far from enjoying
his new post. He was “half sea-sick,” and his one
desire was “to get at a proper time clear of my present
command, in which I am sure of diminishing my little
fortune, which at this moment does not reach 10,000 <i>l.</i>;
and never had I an idea of gaining money by accepting
it.” It would be wrong to infer from this isolated
passage that Nelson was particularly fond of money.
He was not, and the present writer is convinced that
whenever he grumbled about financial matters he
thought considerably more of justice than lucre. He
could not bear to think he was being “done.” In the
present instance it is clear that he found his command
trivial and unprofitable from a national point of view.
Nelson was essentially the man for a big theatre of
action; if he did not actually despise a confined stage
he hated it as paltry and beneath him. He gloried
in a battle, not in a sham-fight; as he himself complained,
“there is nothing to be done on the great
Scale.” He appeals pathetically to Lord St Vincent
in the letter from which the above extract is taken:
“Do you still think of sending me to the Mediterranean?
If not, I am ready to go, for the spur of the occasion,
on the Expedition which is in embryo, but to return
the moment it is over, for I am afraid of my strength.
I am always ready, as far as I am able.” “As far as
September 14th, I am at the Admiralty’s disposal;”
he tells Lady Hamilton, “but, if Mr Buonaparte does
not choose to send his miscreants before that time, my
health will not bear me through equinoctial gales.”
The Admiral is just a little uncertain as to the fate of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Napoleon’s flotilla. “I do not believe they could get
three miles from their own shore,” he says on the 9th
August; on the 10th his “well-grounded hope” is
that the enemy will be “annihilated before they get
ten miles from their own shores.”</p>

<p>Nelson considered Flushing as his “grand object”
of attack, but hesitated to venture before consulting
the Admiralty because “the risk is so great of the
loss of some Vessels.” It would be “a week’s Expedition
for 4000 or 5000 troops.” To aid his own arguments
he appeals to history: “To crush the Enemy
at home was the favourite plan of Lord Chatham, and
I am sure you think it the wisest measure to carry the
war from our own doors.... I own, my dear Lord,
that this Boat warfare is not exactly congenial to my
feelings, and I find I get laughed at for my puny mode
of attack. I shall be happy to lead the way into Helvoet
or Flushing, if Government will turn their thoughts
to it: whilst I serve, I will do it actively, and to the
very best of my abilities. I have all night had a fever,
which is very little abated this morning; my mind
carries me beyond my strength, and will do me up;
but such is my nature. I have serious doubt whether
I shall be able, from my present feelings, to go to the
Mediterranean; but I will do what I can&mdash;I require
nursing like a child. Pray God we may have peace,
and with honour, and then let us start fair with the
rest of Europe.” To other correspondents he says,
“I am very much fagged”; “I am still very unwell,
and my head is swelled.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the weighty arguments brought
forward by Nelson to support his projected attempt
on Flushing, the Lords of the Admiralty could not see
their way to grant the requisite permission. Nelson
was so confident in his belief that he appealed to the
Prime Minister. “Lord St Vincent,” he writes, “tells
me he hates Councils, so do I between Military men;
for if a man consults whether he is to fight, when he
has the power in his own hands, <em>it is certain that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
opinion is against fighting</em>; but that is not the case at
present, and I own I do want good council. Lord
St Vincent is for keeping the Enemy closely blockaded;
but I see that they get along shore inside their Sandbanks,
and under their guns, which line the Coast of
France. Lord Hood is for keeping our Squadrons of
Defence stationary on our own shore, (except light
Cutters, to give information of every movement of the
Enemy;) for the time is approaching when a gale of
westerly wind will disperse our light Squadrons....
When men of such good sense, such great Sea Officers,
differ so widely, is it not natural that I should wish the
mode of defence to be well arranged by the mature
considerations of men of judgment? I mean not to
detract from my judgment; even as it is, it is well
known: but I boast of nothing but my zeal; in that
I will give way to no man upon earth.”</p>

<p>On the night of the 15th August Nelson renewed
his attempt on the Boulogne flotilla. His plan of attack
shows that he took elaborate precautions to preclude
the possibility of failure. La Touche Tréville, in command
at Boulogne, had also profited by his recent
experience with the British, and had fitted out additional
bomb-ketches and placed mortars on smacks
for the purpose of defence. Nelson arranged that
four divisions of ships’ boats should be employed,
each accompanied by one or two flat boats armed with
either an 8-inch howitzer or a 24-pound carronade.
Two boats of each division were to be prepared for
cutting the enemy’s cable and sternfast and to be provided
with stout hook-ropes for the purpose of towing
the prizes. “When any Boats have taken one Vessel,
the business is not to be considered as finished; but a
sufficient number being left to guard the Prize, the others
are immediately to pursue the object, by proceeding
on to the next, and so on, until the whole Flotilla be
either taken, or totally annihilated; for there must
not be the smallest cessation until their destruction
is completely finished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Pikes, cutlasses, tomahawks, axes, and all the paraphernalia
of war were to be placed on the boats. Fast-sailing
cutters were to keep close in shore so as to be
ready to tow out any vessels which might be captured.
“The greatest silence is to be observed by all the people
in the Boats, and the oars to be muffled.” The watchword
was “Nelson,” the answer “Bronté.”</p>

<p>The attack was a failure. The brave fellows found
the vessels not only full of soldiers but defended by
sharp spikes of iron and netting placed round the hulls
in a similar manner to the torpedo netting of modern
naval warfare. It was said by the attacking party
that the French boats were secured to the shore by
stout cables, a belief entertained by Nelson, but La
Touche Tréville indignantly denied the accusation in
his official report. The British seamen went into a
veritable halo of fire, the soldiers on the boats being
assisted by comrades stationed on the heights. It was
an unequal contest in every way, and when the second
division of boats, under Captain Parker, closed with
the enemy, it is stated that the French commander
plainly said so. “You can do nothing here,” he
shouted, “and it is only useless shedding the blood
of brave men to make the attempt.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Parker’s thigh
was shattered while attempting to board the French
Commodore’s boat, another officer was shot through the
leg, and the killed and wounded were numbered at 172.
Officially the French casualties were returned at ten
killed and thirty wounded, probably a low estimate.
“No person can be blamed for sending them to the
attack but myself;” the Commander-in-chief writes to
Lord St Vincent, “I knew the difficulty of the undertaking,
therefore I ventured to ask your opinion.”
He attributed the failure to the divisions not having
arrived “at the same happy moment with Captain
Parker.” “More determined, persevering courage, I
never witnessed.” “I long to pay them, for their
tricks t’other day,” he writes to Lady Hamilton, “the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
debt of a drubbing, which, surely, I’ll pay: but <em>when,
where, or how</em>, it is impossible, your own good sense
must tell you, for me or mortal man to say.”</p>

<p>Nelson was deeply attached to Captain Parker, whom
he calls “my child, for I found him in distress.” His
correspondence at this time is replete with references
to the condition of the patient. “Would I could be
useful,” he tells the doctor, “I would come on shore and
nurse him.” When the gallant officer died at Deal
on the 28th September, the Admiral begged that his
friend’s hair might be cut off; “it shall remain and
be buried with me.” Again we see the wistful, woman-like
emotionalism of Nelson’s nature. He calls it “a
happy release,” and says in the same sentence, “but
I cannot bring myself to say I am glad he is gone;
it would be a lie, for I am grieved almost to death.”
When “the cleverest and quickest man and the most
zealous in the world” was buried at Deal, Nelson
attended the ceremony. It is recorded that the man
who could stare Death in the face without flinching,
who was “in perils oft” and enjoyed the experience,
was visibly affected. The Admiral’s grief was expressed
in a practical way. Finding that the deceased Captain
had left his finances in a most unsatisfactory condition
he paid the creditors in full.</p>

<p>The war with France had lasted eight weary years.
Great Britain had more than maintained her own on
the sea; Napoleon had proved his consummate skill
in the manipulation of land forces. Overtures for
peace were mooted, then definitely made through
M. Otto, a French agent in London for the exchange
of prisoners. The cessation of hostilities became the
topic of the hour. After innumerable delays the
preliminaries were signed in London on the 1st October
1801, to the joy of the populace on both sides of the
Channel. Nelson was not convinced as to Napoleon’s
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonâ fides</i>. He loathed the French and took no pains
to disguise the fact. In writing to a friend a fortnight
or so before he received news of the event mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
above, he admits, “I pray God we may have Peace,
when it can be had with honour; but I fear that the
scoundrel Buonaparte wants to humble us, as he has
done the rest of Europe&mdash;to degrade us in our own eyes,
by making us give up all our conquests, as proof of
our sincerity for making a Peace, and then he will
condescend to treat with us.” The Admiral was not
far wrong, as subsequent events proved. In a letter
dated the 14th September, two days later than the
one from which the above quotation is made, he looks
forward “with hope but will not be too sanguine. I yet
hope the negotiation is not broken entirely off, for we
can never alter the situation of France or the Continent,
and ours will become a War of defence; but I hope
they will do for the best.” Three days after the
signature of the preliminaries of peace he warns the
commanders of the various squadrons that they are
to be “very vigilant in watching the Enemy, and, on
no account to suffer them to put into the Channel, as
hostilities have not yet ceased.” Napoleon confirmed
the treaty on the 5th October, the ratifications were
exchanged on the 10th,</p>

<p class="in0">as a poetaster sang in a contemporary periodical. Nelson
referred to it as “good news,” but received a note from
Addington warning him that his flag must be kept
flying until the Definitive Treaty had been signed.</p>

<p>When he heard that the mob had unharnessed the
horses and drawn the carriage of General Lauriston,
Napoleon’s first <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">aide-de-camp</i> who had brought the
document to London, the Admiral was furious. “Can
you cure madness?” he asks Dr Baird, “for I am mad
to read that ... scoundrels dragged a Frenchman’s
carriage. I am ashamed for my Country.” On the
14th October he formally asked the Admiralty to give
him permission to go on shore. He was then suffering
from “a complaint in my stomach and bowels,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
probably caused by sea-sickness and cold. This
request was not immediately complied with, but towards
the end of the month he was released, and wrote
to Lady Hamilton, “I believe I leave this little
Squadron with sincere regret, and with the good wishes
of every creature in it.” One wonders whether there
could be a more restless nature than Nelson’s, which
made him yearn for the land when at sea, and for the
sea when on land.</p>

<p>He retired to Merton Place, a little estate in Surrey
and “exactly one hour’s drive from Hyde Park.”
This had been purchased on his behalf by Lady Hamilton,
who took up her quarters there with her husband.
The first mention of it in Nelson’s “Dispatches and
Letters,” as edited by Sir Harris Nicolas, is in a note
to his friend Alexander Davison of Morpeth, on the
last day of August 1801. “So far from making money,
I am spending the little I have,” he tells him. “I am
after buying a little Farm at Merton&mdash;the price £9000;
I hope to be able to get through it. If I cannot, after
all my labours for the Country, get such a place as
this, I am resolved to give it all up, and retire for life.”
In thanking Mr Davison for his offer of assistance
in purchasing “the Farm,” Nelson goes a little deeper
into the question of his personal expenditure. It will
“take every farthing I have in the world,” and leave
him in debt. “The Baltic expedition cost me full
£2000. Since I left London it has cost me, for Nelson
cannot be like others, near £1000 in six weeks. If I
am continued here (<i>i.e.</i> in the Downs) ruin to my
finances must be the consequence, for everybody knows
that Lord Nelson <em>is amazingly rich</em>!”</p>

<p>The Admiral took his seat in the House of Lords
as a Viscount on the 29th October, and made his maiden
speech in the upper chamber on the following day.
Appropriately enough it was to second the motion
“That the Thanks of this House be given to Rear-Admiral
Sir James Saumarez, K.B., for his gallant and
distinguished conduct in the Action with the Combined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Fleet of the Enemy, off Algeziras, on the 12th and
13th of July last.” The battle was fought with a
French and Spanish squadron in the Gut of Gibraltar,
details of which were entered into by Nelson, doubtless
to the considerable enlightenment of the House.
During the following month he was also able to pay
a similar tribute to Keith and his officers for their
services in Egypt. With characteristic thoroughness
he also remarked on the part the Army had played in
the defeat of Napoleon’s expedition.</p>

<p>He was feasted and feted for his own splendid work,
but he fell foul of the Corporation of the City of London,
because that body had seen fit to withhold its thanks
for the victory of Copenhagen, conduct which he deemed
“incomprehensible.” He certainly never forgave the
Government for refusing to grant medals for the same
battle. Nelson brought up the question before the
authorities with pugnacious persistence, and some of
the officers renewed their application over a quarter of
a century later, but the Copenhagen medal still remains
to be struck. “I am fixed never to abandon the fair
fame of my Companions in dangers,” he avers. “I
may offend and suffer; but I had rather suffer from
that, than my own feelings.” He fought for pensions
and appointments for all manner of officers and men,
watched the list of vacancies and appealed that they
might be filled by those who deserved well of their
country.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">For</span> over a year Nelson spent the greater part of
his time at Merton Place or at 23 Piccadilly, Sir
William Hamilton’s town house. Any monotony
there may have been was relieved by a tour
of beautiful Wales, made in the months of July and
August 1802, when Nelson’s spirits had recovered
somewhat from the news of his father’s death at Bath
on the 26th of the previous April. The old clergyman’s
distinguished son was ill at the time and did not attend
the last sad ceremony in the quiet churchyard of Burnham
Thorpe, where Nelson said he hoped his bones would
eventually be laid to rest, a wish never to be fulfilled.
His father, who called Merton “the Mansion of Peace,”
had entertained the idea of becoming “one of its inhabitants,”
and rooms had been prepared for him.
“Sir William and myself are both old men, and we will
witness the hero’s felicity in retirement.” Such was
his desire.</p>

<p>On their journey to the Principality Nelson was
presented with the freedom of Oxford, and both Sir
William and the Admiral had the honorary degree of
Doctor of Laws conferred upon them by the University.
A visit was also paid to Blenheim, the ancestral seat of
the Dukes of Marlborough. Gloucester, Ross, Monmouth,
Brecon, Milford, Haverfordwest, Swansea,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Worcester, Birmingham, Warwick and other provincial
cities and towns each accorded its distinguished visitor
a most enthusiastic welcome. He afterwards drew
up an elaborate report on the Forest of Dean for Mr
Addington’s inspection. Properly cultivated it would,
in Nelson’s opinion, “produce about 9200 loads of
timber, fit for building Ships-of-the-line, every year.”
Collingwood, it may be added, was also deeply interested
in afforestation. During the rare occasions he was on
shore he would walk about his estate and stealthily take
an acorn from his pocket and drop it in the earth for
later service in his Majesty’s Navy.</p>

<p>On his return to Surrey Nelson vegetated. “I am
really so very little in the world,” he tells Davison in
October, “that I know little, if anything, beyond [what]
Newspaper reports say respecting our conduct on the
affairs of the Continent. It is true, I have seen Mr
Addington and Lord St Vincent several times; but our
conversations were like Swift’s and Lord Oxford’s. Yet
it was not difficult to discover, that <em>we</em> felt our importance
in the scale of Europe degraded, if Buonaparte was
allowed to act as he has lately done; and that it was
necessary for us to speak a dignified language.... By
the meeting of Parliament many things must come
forth.”</p>

<p>The Hamilton-Nelson family forsook Merton for Piccadilly
at the beginning of 1803, and there Sir William
died on the 6th April, after having been tenderly nursed
by his wife and her more than intimate friend. It is
impossible to think that the Admiral had any heartfelt
sorrow when the former Ambassador breathed his last,
but his emotional nature led him to write the kindest
things of the dead man. “The world never, never
lost a more upright and accomplished gentleman” is
one of his expressions at the event.</p>

<p>The Truce of Amiens, for it was nothing more, was
described by George III. as “an experimental peace.”
Neither side kept strictly to the letter of the Treaty.
Before the brilliant illuminations on both sides of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Channel had been entirely forgotten statesmen began to
shake their heads and to prophecy the withdrawing of
the sword from the scabbard. Napoleon’s continued
aggressions on the Continent, his great colonial schemes,
his restless activity in matters which did not directly
concern him, his threat to invade England showed how
unreal were his wishes for a settled understanding.
Great Britain declared war on the 16th May 1803, thus
ending a peace which had lasted one year and sixteen
days. An embargo was immediately laid on French
ships and those of her allies in British ports or on the
sea; Napoleon had been forestalled, an unusual occurrence.
He had admitted to Decaen, who had been sent
to India to sum up the political situation and to ascertain
the number of troops necessary for the subjugation of
England’s oriental Empire, that he anticipated war
would not break out before September 1804. He was
annoyed, intensely annoyed, and ordered the seizure
of every Briton in France on the pretext that two
merchant vessels had been captured by English frigates
before the declaration of war. This was a gross misrepresentation
of facts; the ships mentioned were taken
on the 18th May, the day Nelson hoisted his flag on the
<i>Victory</i> at Portsmouth as Commander-in-chief of the
Mediterranean. Within forty-eight hours he was at sea.
His was a tremendous programme, and it is only possible
to give an epitome of it here. He was to proceed to
Malta, where he would probably find Rear-Admiral Sir
Richard Bickerton and his squadron, which were to
join him. After having made arrangements with Sir
Alexander Ball for the protection and security of the
island, Nelson was to take up such a position off Toulon
as would enable him to destroy the enemy’s vessels and
to detain those belonging to the allied Batavian Republic.
Particular attention was to be paid to the
proceedings of the French at Genoa, Leghorn, and other
ports of western Italy, “for the purpose of gaining the
most early information of any armaments that may be
formed there, either with a view to an attack upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Egypt or any other port of the Turkish dominions, or
against the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, or the islands
of Corfu.” Should such a plan be in contemplation
Nelson was to do his best to counteract it, “as well as
to afford to the Sublime Porte, and his Sicilian Majesty
and their subjects, any protection or assistance which
may be in your power, consistently with a due attention
to the other important objects entrusted to your care.”</p>

<p>There were good reasons for watching the conduct of
Spain, which purported to be a neutral. The Admiral
was therefore to watch for any sign of naval preparations
by that Power in the Mediterranean and at Cadiz.
No Spanish ships were to be allowed to form a junction
with those of France or Batavia. As certain French
sail-of-the-line recently employed in conveying troops to
San Domingo might attempt to make for a southern
port, Nelson was to detach part of his squadron to
intercept them.</p>

<p>We must now turn our attention for a moment to the
other admirals who watched the movements of the
enemy’s squadrons, or guarded our shores. Cornwallis
was off Ushant, where he could mask the Brest fleet,
Keith was in the Downs, Lord Gardner was at Portsmouth,
Admiral George Montagu&mdash;shortly afterwards
succeeded by Admiral Sir John Colpoys&mdash;was at Plymouth.
Squadrons were detached from these fleets
to watch off such important harbours as Ferrol and
Rochefort, and also off the coast of Holland. The
British colonies were not neglected. “Floating bulwarks”
guarded them, for there was no knowing what
deep-laid manœuvres Napoleon might evolve when once
his super-active brain was bent on the problem of how
to checkmate England on her own native element.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nelson had reached Ushant and was
searching for Cornwallis, with whom he was to leave the
<i>Victory</i>, should the former think an additional sail-of-the-line
necessary. As he did not find the Admiral he left
the ship, shifted his flag to the <i>Amphion</i> frigate, called
at Malta, and joined the fleet off Toulon on the 8th July.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
“With the casual absence of one or two ships, we shall
be always seven sail-of-the-line,” a none too formidable
force to watch the “goings on” in the great southern
arsenal, but he stuck to it with grim tenacity in fair
weather and foul. He soon found that to all appearances
from seven to nine French battle-ships and a
considerable number of frigates and corvettes were
sheltered in the harbour. Unfortunately Nelson’s
vessels were far from being in the best of condition;
several of them were scarcely water-tight. His correspondence
teems with reference to their bad state,
as, for instance: “It is not a store-ship a week which
could keep them in repair”; they had “crazy masts”;
“their hulls want docking”; “I never saw a fleet
altogether so well officered and manned. Would to
God the ships were half as good, but they are what we
call crazy”; “I do not believe that Lord St Vincent
would have kept the sea with such ships,” and so on.</p>

<p>With the <em>personnel</em> of the fleet Nelson had little fault
to find, although he had occasion to issue a General
Memorandum respecting the desertion of certain seamen
or marines to the service of Spain. In his eyes nothing
could atone for such conduct: “A Briton to put himself
under the lash of a Frenchman or Spaniard must
be more degrading to any man of spirit than any punishment
I could inflict on their bodies.” With this exception
all was well. While “miserably short of men,”
he was able to declare, towards the end of September
1803: “We are at this moment the healthiest squadron
I ever served in, for the fact is we have no sick, and are
all in good humour,” moreover they were “in fine order
to give the French a dressing.” Again: “The squadron
has health beyond what I have almost ever seen, except
our going to the Nile; and I hope, if the French will give
us the opportunity, that our beef and pudding will be
as well applied.” No Admiral, before or since, has ever
paid more attention to the health and comfort of the
men who served under him. In the Memorandum to
which we have just referred he contrasts the “one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
shilling per day, and plenty of the very best provisions,
with every comfort that can be thought of,” with the
“twopence a day, black bread, horse-beans, and stinking
oil” allotted to those in the service of the enemy.
Scurvy was rife when he joined the fleet, but Nelson
obtained onions and lemons, recognised aids to the cure
of the disorder, “and a sight of the French squadron
twenty leagues at sea will cure all our complaints.”
Writing in August to his friend Dr Baird he seeks to
entertain the physician by relating particulars of his
treatment for scurvy. “I am now at work in Spain,”
he remarks, “and have procured some bullocks and a
good supply of onions&mdash;the latter we have found the
greatest advantage from.” He adds: “The health of our
seamen is invaluable; and to purchase that, no expense
ought to be spared.” He even managed to secure cattle
and vegetables from France. The fleet was watered
at the Madalena Islands.</p>

<p>At the end of July the <i>Victory</i>, having been returned
to the fleet by Cornwallis, again became Nelson’s flagship.
As to the ultimate destination of the Toulon
fleet Nelson was in doubt; that it was to sail before long
he felt convinced owing to the activity manifest in the
harbours. He rightly judged Napoleon’s character:
“We know he is not very scrupulous in the honourable
means of accomplishing his darling object.... My
firm opinion is, that the Mediterranean will again be an
active scene; and if Ministers do not look out, I shall
have the Brest fleet to pay me a visit; for as the army
can only be moved by the protection of a superior fleet,
that fleet they will try to have, and a month’s start
of us would do all the mischief.” At that time (July)
he believed that Napoleon would make an attempt on
the Morea, perhaps in concert with Russia, the downfall
of the Turkish Empire in Europe would follow, and
“Candia and Egypt would, of course, if this plan is
followed, be given to the French, when, sooner or later,
farewell India!” Of the enormous flotilla which
Napoleon was building at Boulogne and elsewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Nelson thought little, if at all. “What! he begins to
find excuses!” he writes to Ball. “I thought he would
invade England in the face of the sun! Now he wants
a three-days’ fog, that never yet happened! and if it
did, how are his craft to be kept together? He will
soon find more excuses or there will be an end of Bonaparte,
and may the devil take him!” He was more
concerned, and with reason, as to the whereabouts of
the fleet returning from San Domingo, which he thought
would “come to the Mediterranean&mdash;perhaps, first to
Cadiz, to get the Spaniards to escort them. If so, I
may have two fleets to fight; but if I have the ships,
the more the merrier.” In August the Admiral tells
Addington: “I am looking out for the French squadron&mdash;perhaps
you may think impatiently; but I have made
up my mind never to go into port till after the battle,
if they make me wait a year, provided the Admiralty
change the ships, who cannot keep the sea in the winter,
except <i>Victory</i>, <i>Canopus</i>, <i>Donegal</i>, and <i>Belleisle</i>.” The
fitting out of an expedition at Marseilles led Nelson to
think that the invasion of Sardinia was contemplated.
He therefore detached the only two frigates he had with
him at the moment to cruise off Ajaccio to endeavour
to intercept the enemy should they come that way.
“Of course they will say that we have broken the
neutrality if we attack them in the ports of Sardinia
before their conquest, and if we do not I shall be laughed
at for a fool. Prevention is better than cure....
My station to the westward of Toulon, an unusual one,
has been taken upon an idea that the French fleet is
bound out of the Straits, and probably to Ireland. It
is said 10,000 men are collecting at Toulon. I shall
follow them to the Antipodes.”</p>

<p>To Sir Richard Strachan he thus sums up the situation
on the 26th August: “The French fleet being perfectly
ready for sea, seven of the line, six frigates, and some
corvettes&mdash;two sail-of-the-line are now rigging in the
arsenal&mdash;I think it more than probable that they are
bound to the westward, out of the Mediterranean.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Therefore, as I am determined to follow them, go where
they may, I wish you, in case they escape me, to send
a frigate or sloop after them to find out their route,
giving her a station where I may find her, and keep
yourself either at the mouth of the Straits or off Europa
Point, for I certainly shall not anchor at Gibraltar.”
In the middle of October he is still as uncertain as ever
as to the destination of the French. Some folk favoured
the Morea, others Egypt, “and they may be bound
outside the Mediterranean.” “Is it Ireland or the
Levant?” he asks Ball in the early days of dreary
November.</p>

<p>Think for one moment, as you sit reading this book
in a comfortable room or on a little hillock in the open
country, of the ceaseless vigil of Nelson as his weather-beaten
vessels lay off Toulon. When a sea fog obscured
his quarry he was in a fever of anxiety. “It was thick
for two days,” he tells his brother William on one
occasion, “and our frigates could not look into Toulon;
however, I was relieved, for the first time in my life,
by being informed the French were still in port.” Then
there was always the possibility that the Brest fleet
might escape and make its appearance at an awkward
moment, and the likelihood of a visit from the returning
squadron from the West Indies. He early discerned the
outbreak of war with Spain. Pretending to be a neutral,
that Power most assuredly exhibited the most flagrant
favouritism for France. We have noted that Nelson
anticipated the aid of the Dons to the French in the
matter of the ships from San Domingo, help that was
readily given when the vessels, evading Rear-admiral
Campbell, stole into Coruña. This, of course,
necessitated a strict blockade of the port, and Pellew
was sent there instead of stationing himself off Rochefort
as had been originally intended. References to them
are frequent in his correspondence. Writing to the
British Consul at Barcelona under date of the 13th
September Nelson claimed “every indulgence which is
shown to the ships of our enemies. The French squadron<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
at Coruña are acting almost as they please; the <i>Aigle</i>
French ship of war is not turned out of Cadiz,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> the French
frigate <i>Revenge</i> is permitted to go out of that port,
cruise, and return with prizes, and sell them. I will
not state that every Spanish port is a home for French
privateers, for this is well known; and I am informed
that even at Barcelona English vessels captured by the
French have been sold there. You will acquaint his
Excellency [the Captain-general] that I claim for every
British ship, or squadron, the right of lying as long as
I please in the ports of Spain, whilst it is allowed to other
powers; that I claim the rights of hospitality and
civility, and every other right which the harmony
subsisting between our sovereigns entitles us to.” This
communication was followed thirteen days later by
a despatch to Strachan in which Nelson is not only
prophetic, but exhibits a cautious mood not usually
associated with “the Nelson whom Britons love.” In
this respect he has been much maligned. In battle his
genius enabled him to see a little ahead of more ordinary
men, but he never overstepped the bounds of prudence.
“The occurrences which pass every day in Spain forebode,
I fancy, a speedy war with England; therefore
it becomes proper for me to put you upon your guard,
and advise you how to act under particular circumstances.
By looking at the former line of conduct on
the part of Spain, which she followed just before the
commencement of the last war, we may naturally expect
the same events to happen. The French Admiral
Richery was in Cadiz, blocked up by Admiral Man:
on 22 August they came to sea attended by the
Spanish fleet, which saw the French safe beyond St
Vincent, and returned into Cadiz. Admiral Man very
properly did not choose to attack Admiral Richery
under such an escort. This is a prelude to what I must
request your strict attention to; at the same time, I
am fully aware that you must be guided, in some measure,
by actual circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
“I think it very probable, even before Spain breaks
with us, that they may send a ship or two of the line
to see <i>l’Aigle</i> round Cape St Vincent; and that if you
attack her in their presence, they may attack you;
and giving them possession of the <i>Donegal</i> would be more
than either you or I should wish, therefore I am certain
it must be very comfortable for you to know my sentiments.
From what you hear in Cadiz, you will judge
how far you may venture yourself in company with
a Spanish squadron; but if you are of opinion that
you may trust yourself near them, keeping certainly
out of gun-shot, send your boat with a letter to the
Spanish commodore, and desire to know whether he
means to defend the French ships; and get his answer
in writing, and have it as plain as possible. If it be
‘yes, that he will fire at you if you attack the French
under his protection,’ then, if you have force enough,
make your attack on the whole body, and take them
all if you can, for I should consider such an answer as
a perfect declaration of war. If you are too weak for
such an attack, you must desist; but you certainly
are fully authorised to take the ships of Spain whenever
you meet them. Should the answer be ambiguous,
you must then act as your judgment may direct you,
and I am sure that will be very proper. Only recollect,
that it would be much better to let the French ships
escape, than to run too great a risk of losing the <i>Donegal</i>,
yourself, and ship’s company.” To Addington he
states that “The Spaniards are now so very uncivil
to our ships, that I suppose we shall not be much longer
friends.” To John Hookham Frere, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</i>
at Madrid, he admits, “We have given up French
vessels taken within gun-shot of the Spanish shore, and
yet French vessels are permitted to attack our ships
from the Spanish shore. Your Excellency may assure
the Spanish Government, that in whatever place the
Spaniards allow the French to attack us, in that place
I shall order the French to be attacked. The old order
of 1771, now put in force against us, is infamous; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
I trust your Excellency will take proper steps that the
present mode of enforcing it be done away. It is gross
partiality, and not neutrality.”</p>

<p>There is a pathetic letter dated the 12th December
1803 in which Nelson confides to his old friend Davison
some of the perils which he encountered daily. “My
crazy fleet,” he writes, “are getting in a very indifferent
state, and others will soon follow. The finest ships in
the service will soon be destroyed. I know well enough
that if I was to go into Malta, I should save the ships
during this bad season. But if I am to watch the
French, I must be at sea, and if at sea, must have bad
weather; and if the ships are not fit to stand bad
weather, they are useless.... But my time of service is
nearly over. A natural anxiety, of course, must attend
my station; but, my dear friend, my eyesight fails me
most dreadfully. I firmly believe that, in a very few
years, I shall be stone-blind. It is this only, of all my
maladies, that makes me unhappy; but God’s will be
done.”</p>

<p>Nelson had taken up his station “to the westward
of Sicie,” a position enabling him “to prevent the
junction of a Spanish fleet from the westward,” and
also “to take shelter in a few hours either under the
Hières Islands or Cape St Sebastian; and I have hitherto
found the advantage of the position. Now Spain,
having settled her neutrality”&mdash;he is writing on the 12th
December to Lord St Vincent&mdash;“I am taking my
winter’s station under St Sebastian, to avoid the heavy
seas in the gulf, and keep frigates off Toulon. From
September we have experienced such a series of bad
weather that is rarely met with, and I am sorry to say
that all the ships which have been from England in
the late war severely feel it.... I know no way of
watching the enemy but to be at sea, and therefore
good ships are necessary.” On the same day he
informs a third correspondent that the enemy at
Toulon “are perfectly ready to put to sea, and they
must soon come out, but who shall [say] where they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
are bound? My opinion is, certainly out of the
Mediterranean.”</p>

<p>“We have had a most terrible winter: it has almost
knocked me up,” he tells Elliot within a few days of
the close of this anxious year. “I have been very ill,
and am now far from recovered, but I hope to hold out
till the battle is over, when I must recruit myself for
some future exertion.”</p>

<p>An Indomitable Spirit this, the greatest sailor of all
time!</p>

</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A new</span> year had dawned. “The storm is
brewing,” Nelson wrote, and he thought
Sardinia “one of the objects of its violence.”
If that island were captured or ceded to the enemy,
“Sicily, Malta, Egypt, &amp;c., &amp;c., is lost, sooner or
later.” The Madalena Islands, to the north of Sardinia,
not only afforded the ships a safe anchorage but ensured
plenty of fresh water and provisions: “Sardinia is the
most important post in the Mediterranean. It covers
Naples, Sicily, Malta, Egypt, and all the Turkish
dominions; it blockades Toulon; the wind which
would carry a French fleet to the westward is fair from
Sardinia; and Madalena is the most important station
in this most important island. I am told that the
revenues, after paying the expenses of the island, do
not give the king 5000 <i>l.</i> sterling a year. If it is so,
I would give him 500,000 <i>l.</i> to cede it, which would
give him 25,000 <i>l.</i> a year for ever. This is only my
conversation, and not to be noticed&mdash;but the king
cannot long hold Sardinia.” On the 11th February
1804 he assures “my dear friend” Ball that “we are
... on the eve of great events; the sooner they
come the better.” Private letters led him to believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
that the squadrons at Brest and Ferrol were to form
a junction with that at Toulon. Should his surmise
prove correct he inferred an invasion of both the Morea
and Egypt, a belief fostered by the wily Napoleon by
means of a camp under General St Cyr at Taranto, in
the heel of Italy.</p>

<p>Nelson communicated his notions to the Grand Vizier.
“Your Highness,” he adds, “knows them too well to
put any confidence in what they say. Bonaparte’s
tongue is that of a serpent oiled. Nothing shall be
wanting on my part to frustrate the designs of this
common disturber of the human race.”</p>

<p>He pens a little grumble to Dr Moseley in March,
complaining that the Mediterranean fleet seems “forgotten
by the great folks at home,” but adding with
pardonable pride that although the vessels have been
at sea a week short of ten months, “not a ship has been
refitted or recruited, excepting what has been done
at sea. You will readily believe that all this must
have shaken me. My sight is getting very bad, but <em>I</em>
must not be sick until after the French fleet is taken.”
He includes some facts regarding his manifold interests
as Commander-in-chief. He always had good mutton
for invalids, gave half the allowance of grog instead of
all wine in winter, changed the cruising ground so as
not to allow “the sameness of prospect to satiate the
mind,” obtained onions, “the best thing that can be
given to seamen,” by sending a ship for them to Corsica,
and always had “plenty of fresh water.” In the
stirring days of the first decade of the nineteenth century
a British Admiral was in very truth “shepherd of his
flock.” He thought for the men and their officers, saw
to their creature comforts, even provided amusement
for them. Moreover, he had to be a diplomatist, something
of a soldier, and a man of resource and reliance.
The sailors of England alone made invasion impossible
and nullified the superhuman efforts of the greatest
soldier of recorded history to subjugate the Island
Kingdom. Unpreparedness is peculiarly characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
of British policy. It will not surprise students to
be told at the beginning of 1804 there were ten fewer
sail-of-the-line than had been available before the
Peace of Amiens. Weight of brain has won more
battles than weight of metal, although it is safer and
wiser to have a preponderating supply of both. We
shall see what a dearth of frigates, which are “the eyes
of a fleet,” to use Nelson’s apt expression, meant to the
Admiral in the prelude to the Trafalgar campaign. He
was already complaining of their absence.</p>

<p>La Touche Tréville was now in command at Toulon.
Nelson disliked the man as sincerely as he loathed the
nation whom he represented; he could “never trust
a Corsican or a Frenchman.” La Touche Tréville
had been commodore, it will be remembered, of the
Boulogne flotilla when Nelson had made his abortive
attacks on it. These were lauded all over France
as “glorious contests.” Nelson was what is usually
called, by a strange misnomer, “a good hater.” Thus
to duty was added a personal rivalry that filled
him with an ardent longing to “get even” with his
antagonist.</p>

<p>Napoleon had now a sufficient number of small boats
at Boulogne and neighbouring ports for the conveyance
of his 130,000 troops to England. He had abandoned
his original plan and was determined that the Navy
proper should play an important part in the perilous
project. The Toulon fleet, after releasing the French
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’Aigle</i> at Cadiz, was to be joined by five ships off
Rochefort under Villeneuve, and then hasten to Boulogne
to convoy the flotilla. The rôle of the squadron at
Brest was to be passive, although reports were spread
far and wide that the ships there were to take an army
to Ireland. This was done so that Cornwallis, blockading
that port, might not form a junction with the
squadron in the Downs for the purpose of opposing
the crossing of the vast armament from the northern
seaport. If all these combinations were successfully
carried out Napoleon would have sixteen sail-of-the-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>line
ready for the master-stroke. Everything depended
on whether the English blockading squadrons
off Toulon, Cadiz, Rochefort, and in the Downs could
be eluded.</p>

<p>On the 8th April Nelson again wrote, “We are on
the eve of great events,” and proceeded to tell his
correspondent that two sail-of-the-line had “put their
heads outside Toulon,” and a little later “they all
came out. We have had a gale of wind and calm since;
therefore I do not know whether they are returned to
port or have kept the sea. I have only to wish to get
alongside of them with the present fleet under my
command; so highly officered and manned, the event
ought not to be doubted.”</p>

<p>“If we go on playing out and in, we shall some day
get at them,” he tells Frere.</p>

<p>Monsieur La Touche was merely exercising his ships;
the time for the grand coup was not yet come. Nelson’s
opinion now was that the Brest fleet and a squadron
he does not name, but probably that at Rochefort,
were destined for the Mediterranean “either before
or after they may have thrown their cargo of troops
on shore in Ireland. Egypt and the Morea supposed
to be their next object after their English and Irish
schemes.” On the 24th May the French made a
further excursion, five sail-of-the-line, three frigates,
and several smaller vessels came out of the harbour,
which was being watched by a small squadron under
Rear-Admiral Campbell. Nelson did not believe in
showing the whole of his available resources to the
enemy. By being out of sight he hoped to entice the
enemy to leave their safe anchorage: “My system is
the very contrary of blockading.” He was delighted
that Campbell did not allow the French to bring him
to action with the small resources at his disposal,
which is another example of Nelson’s cautious methods.
He thanked the admiral by letter, and concluded by
saying, “I have no doubt but an opportunity will offer
of giving them fair battle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Nelson continued to complain of ill health. “A sort
of rheumatic fever,” “blood gushing up the left side
of my head, and the moment it covers the brain, I
am fast asleep,” a “violent pain in my side, and night-sweats”&mdash;this
is his condition as he diagnosed it to
Dr Baird on the 30th May. A week later he is buoyant
at the thought of battle: “Some happy day I expect
to see his (La Touche Tréville’s) eight sail, which are in
the outer road, come out; and if he will get abreast of
Porquerolle, I will try what stuff he is made of; therefore
you see I have no occasion to be fretful; on the
contrary, I am full of hopes, and command a fleet
which never gives me an uneasy moment.”</p>

<p>Eight French sail-of-the-line, accompanied by half
a dozen frigates, made an excursion on the 14th June,
and Campbell was again chased. The latter sailed
towards the main fleet, but La Touche Tréville was
by no means anxious to try conclusions with his old
enemy. After sailing about four leagues, he crept
back to safer quarters. The British Admiral afterwards
referred to this little excursion as a “caper.”
“I was off with five ships-of-the-line,” he adds, “and
brought to for his attack, although I did not believe
that anything was meant serious, but merely a gasconade.”
With this conclusion La Touche Tréville begged
to differ. He saw in the “caper” a bold manœuvre
and an excellent opportunity for currying favour in
the eyes of his exacting chief, who by no means
overrated the commander’s abilities. His despatch
to Napoleon runs as follows:<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>“I have the honour to give you an account of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sortie</i> of the whole of the squadron under my orders.
Having been advised that several English privateers
were infesting the coast and the Islands of Hyères, I
gave orders, three days ago, to the frigates <i>Incorruptible</i>
and <i>Siren</i> and the brig <i>Ferret</i> to proceed to the Bay of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Hyères. The Easterly wind being against them they
anchored under the Castle of Porqueroles. Yesterday
morning the enemy became aware of their presence.
Towards noon they detached two frigates and another
vessel, which entered by the broad passage with the
intention of cutting off the retreat of our frigates. As
soon as I saw this manœuvre I signalled to the whole
squadron to make sail, and this was done. In fourteen
minutes all were under sail and I made for the enemy
in order to cut him off from the narrow passage and to
follow him up if he attempted it. But the English
Admiral soon gave up his design, recalled his vessel and
his two frigates engaged amongst the Islands and took
to flight. I pursued him till nightfall; he was heading
for the S.E. At daybreak I had lost sight of him.”</p>

<p>When Nelson heard of this communication he was
furious. “You will have seen his letter of how he
chased me and how I ran,” he tells his brother, the
Rev. W. Nelson. “I keep it; and, by &mdash;&mdash;, if I take
him he shall eat it!”</p>

<p>Nelson continued to fear the loss of Sardinia, which
“will be great indeed.” In this matter he was wrong,
for Napoleon entertained no idea of conquest in that
direction. There was every indication, on the other
hand, that he might do so, and the Admiral is not
to be blamed but praised for his zeal in behalf of
the island which meant so much to the fleet under
his command. When he heard that Vice-Admiral
Ganteaume had hoisted his flag at Brest he was sure
that an attempt would be made to reach the Mediterranean.
“The French navy is daily increasing, both
at Toulon and Brest, whilst ours is as clearly going
down-hill,” is Nelson’s summing-up of the situation
in the early days of July 1804. He then pours out the
vials of his wrath on Addington’s administration because
it had not taken sufficiently to heart the old adage,
“in times of peace prepare for war”: “We made use
of the peace, not to recruit our navy, but to be the
cause of its ruin. Nothing but a speedy battle, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
complete annihilation of the enemy’s fleets, and a
seven years’ peace, can get our fleet in the order it ought
to be; therefore I, for one, do not wish to be shackled
with allies. I am for assisting Europe to the utmost
of my power, but no treaties, which England only
keeps.” This was with reference to a suggested treaty
with Russia: “Such alliances have never benefited our
country.” Europe, he says, is “degenerate.” A month
later he refers to his “shattered carcase,” which “requires
rest.” Then he bows to Fate, says he submits,
and states that all his wishes “now rest that I may
meet Monsieur La Touche before October is over.”</p>

<p>La Touche Tréville died on the 18th August 1804.
He was buried on Cape Sepet, his successor, Villeneuve,
making a funeral oration. Unaware that his enemy
was vanquished, we find Nelson writing on the 19th
that “Such a liar is below my notice, except to thrash
him, which will be done,” if in his power. “I never
heard of his acting otherwise than as a poltroon and a
liar,” is another of his remarks, which scarcely soften
when he heard the “miscreant” was in his coffin:
“La Touche has given me the slip&mdash;he died of the
colic; perhaps Bonaparte’s, for they say he was a
rank republican.” With misplaced humour the French
press asserted that the Admiral had died of over-exertion
due to “walking so often up to the signal-post upon
Sepet to watch the British fleet.”</p>

<p>War with Spain, which Nelson had predicted, was
formally declared by that Power on the 12th December
1804. Napoleon had already exacted a handsome
annual sum from her treasury, a matter overlooked
by the British Government for reasons of policy. When
he secured the assistance of the Spanish navy, Pitt,
who was again in office, refused to be hoodwinked,
and warned the traitorous neutrals. As this was
unheeded, four frigates, two of which belonged to
Nelson’s fleet, were sent to intercept four treasure
ships from South America off Cadiz. The two forces
came in sight on the 5th October. Although the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Spanish vessels were not prepared to fight, an action
took place consequent on the commander refusing to
surrender. The Spanish <i>Mercedes</i> blew up, and the
others were seized as prizes. A declaration of war,
prompted by Napoleon, was the result. The ruler of
France was playing into his own hands with his usual
unscrupulous skill.</p>

<p>The command off Cadiz had now been given to Sir
John Orde. Nelson, quite naturally, did not approve
this apportioning out of what he regarded as his own
preserves. “I almost begin to think,” he says, with
reference to Orde, “that he is sent off Cadiz to reap
the golden harvest, as Campbell was sent off Cadiz
by Cornwallis (by orders from England) to reap my
sugar harvest. It’s very odd, two Admiralties to treat
me so: surely I have dreamt that I have ‘done the
State some service.’ But never mind; I am superior
to those who could treat me so. When am I to be
relieved?”</p>

<p>Not yet! There was much to do and darker days
to be lived through before the Master Mariner could
sleep peacefully ashore.</p>

<span class="smcap">Nelson.</span>
</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Napoleon</span> had now completed further plans.
These he fondly hoped would lead to the downfall
of British rule in the United Kingdom
and the eventual dismemberment of the Empire. His
strategy, if somewhat involved, was deeply laid. Instead
of concentrating his fleet in European waters,
that very essential part of the programme was to be
undertaken in the Atlantic. By means of feints and
false intelligence it was anticipated that Nelson would
again suppose that the East was the destination of the
French armament. Again much depended on whether
Napoleon’s commanders at Rochefort and Toulon
would prove sufficiently clever to elude the blockading
squadrons and to carry out the subsequent junction.
The former was to make for Martinique, the latter for
Cayenne. Having spread ruin and disaster in the
British West Indies, they were to unite, release the
squadron at Ferrol, and return to Rochefort to threaten
Cornwallis, who would thus be precluded from lending
assistance elsewhere. Ganteaume at Brest was to play
the chief part. He was to make a descent on Ireland
while his colleagues were crossing the Atlantic and then
cover the invading army from Boulogne.</p>

<p>On the 11th January 1805 Missiessy, in command<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
at Rochefort, made good his escape, and eventually
reached the West Indies. A week after his colleague
had left port Villeneuve was also at sea. The great
war game had begun. “Our frigates saw part of
them all day, and were chased by some of the ships,”
Nelson informs Sir John Acton. The Admiral received
the report of the enemy’s sailing at Madalena at
3 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> on the 19th. Three hours later “the whole
fleet was at sea,” steering for the south end of Sardinia,
“where I could have little fear but that I should meet
them; for, from all I have heard from the captains of
the frigates, the enemy must be bound round the south
end of Sardinia, but whether to Cagliari, Sicily, the
Morea, or Egypt, I am most completely in ignorance.”
He warns Acton to be on his guard for Sicily and to
send information to Naples. On the 21st a French
frigate was discerned off the south end of Sardinia,
but became lost in the fog, and a little later Nelson
heard that one of the French sail-of-the-line had put
in at Ajaccio in a distressed condition. On the
27th he was off Palermo. “One of two things must
have happened,” he conjectures, “that either the
French fleet must have put back crippled, or that they
are gone to the eastward, probably to Egypt, therefore
I find no difficulty in pursuing the line of conduct
I have adopted. If the enemy have put back crippled,
I could never overtake them, and therefore I can do
no harm in going to the eastward; and if the enemy
are gone to the eastward, I am right.” He sent vessels
to call at Elba, San Fiorenzo, Malta, Tunis, Pantellaria,
Toro and other places to obtain information. He
believed that eleven sail-of-the-line and nine smaller
vessels were at sea. “I shall only hope to fall in with
them.”</p>

<p>On the 11th February Nelson was still in “total
ignorance” regarding the whereabouts of the French
fleet, but was more than ever confirmed in his opinion
that Egypt was its destination. He had set off for
the Morea, and then proceeded to Egypt, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
enemy had eluded him. It was not until he arrived
off Malta on the 19th that he received authentic information
that the Toulon fleet had put back to port
“in a very crippled state.” He himself was able to
report that the health of his men was excellent, and
“although we have experienced a great deal of bad
weather, have received no damage, and not a yard
or mast sprung or crippled, or scarcely a sail split.”
“I have consulted no man,” he had written to Lord
Melville on the anniversary of the battle of Cape St
Vincent, “therefore the whole blame in forming my
judgment must rest with me. I would allow no man
to take from me an atom of my glory had I fallen in
with the French fleet, nor do I desire any man to partake
of any of the responsibility&mdash;all is mine, right or
wrong.”</p>

<p>Misfortune had dogged Villeneuve almost from the
moment he had left Toulon. After encountering a
gale in the Gulf of Lyons his ships were in such a pitiful
state that there was no alternative but to return. He
complained bitterly, and not without reason, to the
Minister of Marine about the wretched condition of
the fleet at his disposal. The vessels, according to
his report, were built of superannuated or bad materials,
and lost masts or sails “at every puff of wind.” In
addition they were short-handed, the sailors were inexperienced,
and the decks were encumbered with
troops. Napoleon, who never appreciated the many
difficulties of navigation, let alone of naval warfare,
entertained the notion that the Navy could be run
with practically as much precision as the Army; conditions
of weather he almost contemptuously dismissed
as of little account. He abruptly tells Villeneuve the
plain unvarnished truth, namely that the great evil of
the service “is that the men who command it are
unused to all the risks of command.” Almost in
despair he asks, “What is to be done with admirals
who allow their spirits to sink, and determine to hasten
home at the first damage they may receive?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Villeneuve was not a courageous commander. He
hated taking risks. It may be that he realised his
own personal limitations to some extent; it is certain
that he fully appreciated those of his men and of his
ships. The only training-place for sailors is the sea,
and such excursions as had been made were as nothing
compared to the daily encounters with storm, wind and
tide which fell to the lot of the blockading squadron
below the horizon.</p>

<p>Such obvious facts appealed to that sense of grim
humour which is so essentially characteristic of Nelson.
He thoroughly enjoyed his adversary’s discomfiture,
and poked fun at Napoleon, his men and his methods,
on every possible occasion. “Bonaparte,” he writes
to Collingwood on the 13th March, “has often made
his brags that our fleet would be worn out by keeping
the sea; that his was kept in order and increasing by
staying in port; but he now finds, I fancy, if <em>Emperors</em>
hear truth, that his fleet suffers more in one night than
ours in a year.”</p>

<p>Napoleon, now the Imperial Incarnation of the
Revolution, for he had crowned himself Emperor of the
French on the 2nd December 1804, was not to be
thwarted because his subordinates had failed to bring
his giant schemes to a successful issue on two distinct
occasions. He was obsessed by a desire to “leap the
ditch.” To humble that Island Power which was ever
in his way, to strike at the very heart of that England
whose wealth was lavished in fostering coalition after
coalition, were now his fondest hopes. He thought,
talked, and wrote of little else.</p>

<p>While his third plan was more involved than the
others, it had the advantage of calling a greater number
of ships into service. Villeneuve was to start from
Toulon with eleven ships, release the Spanish squadron
of six sail-of-the-line under the command of Admiral
Gravina, and one French ship, at Cadiz, and then make
for Martinique, where he would find Missiessy’s squadron
of five sail. In a similar manner the twenty-one ships<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
of Ganteaume’s fleet at Brest were to rally Gourdon’s
fifteen vessels at Ferrol and also proceed to the West
Indies. Thus no fewer than fifty-nine sail and many
smaller vessels would be congregated for the final
effort. While Nelson was searching for them, this
immense armament, with Ganteaume in supreme
command, would recross the Atlantic, appear off
Boulogne, and convoy the flotilla to England. It is
unnecessary to give the alternative plans furnished to
the admirals. To do so would only tend to involve
the broad outline of the manœuvre as detailed above
and serve no essential purpose.</p>

<p>Spurred on by Napoleon’s displeasure, Villeneuve
put to sea on the night of the 30th March 1805, and
was sighted “with all sail set” by two British frigates
on the following morning. It was not until the 4th
April that Nelson, then off Toro, received this useful
if vague intelligence, for the frigate which had followed
in the tracks of the Toulon fleet had lost sight of the
enemy. Her captain “thinks they either bore away
to the eastward or steered S.S.W., as they were going
when first seen,” Nelson informs the Admiralty. He
“covered the Channel from Barbary to Toro with
frigates and the fleet” in the hope of discovering them
or obtaining reliable information as to their whereabouts.
On the 18th April he says, “I am going out
of the Mediterranean after the French fleet. It may
be thought that I have protected too well Sardinia,
Naples, Sicily, the Morea, and Egypt, from the French;
but I feel I have done right, and am therefore easy
about any fate which may await me for having missed
the French fleet. I have left five frigates, besides the
sloops, &amp;c., stationed at Malta for the present service
of the Mediterranean, and with the Neapolitan squadron
will, of course, be fully able to prevent any force the
French have left to convoy troops to Sicily.”</p>

<p>Nelson only succeeded in making sixty-five leagues
in nine days “owing to very bad weather.” It was
not until the 18th April, when Villeneuve had been at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
sea nearly three weeks, that he had news of the enemy
having passed through the Straits on the 8th. “I am
proceeding with the fleet under my command as expeditiously
as possible to the westward in pursuit
of them.” Sir John Orde had so far forgotten or
neglected his duty that when Villeneuve made his
appearance at Cadiz the commander of the blockading
squadron made off without either sending word to
Nelson or leaving a frigate to keep in touch with the
enemy. Consequently Nelson was still uncertain as
to their destination. “The circumstance of their
having taken the Spanish ships which were [ready]
for sea from Cadiz, satisfies my mind that they are not
bound to the West Indies (nor probably the Brazils);
but intend forming a junction with the squadron at
Ferrol, and pushing direct for Ireland or Brest, as
I believe the French have troops on board.” When
off Tetuan on the 4th May he rightly observes, “I
cannot very properly run to the West Indies without
something beyond mere surmise; and if I defer my
departure, Jamaica may be lost. Indeed, as they
have a month’s start of me, I see no prospect of getting
out time enough to prevent much mischief from being
done.” Gibraltar Bay was reached on the 6th May,
and at 6 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, Nelson was making his way through the
Gut owing to there being “every appearance of a
Levanter coming on.” Off Cape St Vincent he hoped
to be met by a frigate from Orde with intelligence of
the enemy’s route and also by a frigate from Lisbon.
“If nothing is heard of them from Lisbon or from the
frigates I may find off Cape St Vincent, I shall probably
think the rumours which are spread are true, that
their destination is the West Indies, and in that case
think it my duty to follow them, or to the Antipodes,
should I believe that to be their destination. I shall
detach a sloop of war to England from off the Cape,
when my mind is made up from either information or
the want of it.”</p>

<p>Nelson’s idea as to the destination of the allied fleet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
was corroborated by Commodore Donald Campbell,
a Scotsman who had entered the Portuguese navy.
After clearing transports and taking on board sufficient
provisions for five months, he set out from Lagos Bay
with ten sail-of-the-line and a number of smaller craft
on his long chase. “My lot is cast,” he hurriedly
informs Ball, “and I am going to the West Indies,
where, although I am late, yet chance may have given
them a bad passage and me a good one. I must hope
the best.”</p>

<p>Many minds, many opinions. What had become
of the Allied fleet? Even more important, what had
it accomplished? Such questions must have been
ever present in the mind of Nelson and his officers.
Everything about the enemy was so vague as almost
to suggest a phantom fleet. “I still think Jamaica
is their object,” is Nelson’s comment on the 27th of
May when making for Barbadoes, “but many think
Surinam or Trinidad; and Bayntun, that they will
land their troops at the city of San Domingo. In
short, everyone has an opinion, but it will soon be
beyond doubt. Our passage, although not very quick,
has been far from a bad one. They started from Cadiz
thirty-one days before we did from St Vincent, and I
think we shall gain fourteen days upon them in the
passage; therefore they will only arrive seventeen
days before us at Martinique, for I suppose them bound
there. I shall not anchor at Barbadoes.... I have
prayed Lord Seaforth to lay an embargo, that the
French may not know of my approach, and thus again
elude our vigilance. My mind is not altered that
Egypt was their destination last January.” Eight days
later, when the fleet was in Carlisle Bay, Barbadoes,
and Nelson’s force had been augmented by the addition
of two battleships under Cochrane, we are informed
that “There is not a doubt in any of the admirals’
or generals’ minds, but that Tobago and Trinidad are
the enemy’s objects; and although I am anxious in
the extreme to get at their eighteen sail-of-the-line, yet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
as Sir William Myers has offered to embark himself
with 2000 troops, I cannot refuse such a handsome
offer; and, with the blessing of God on a just cause,
I see no cause to doubt of the annihilation of both the
enemy’s fleet and army.”</p>

<p>It happened that the general had received a letter
on the previous night from Brigadier-General Brereton,
stationed at St Lucia, informing him that the enemy’s
fleet, “steering to the southward,” had been reported
as passing that island during the late hours of the 28th
May. According to Brereton’s supposition its destination
“must be either Barbadoes or Trinidad.”</p>

<p>Knowing full well that if the intelligence proved
false it would lose him the French fleet, but having no
alternative, Nelson set off for Tobago, where he learnt
from the captain of an American vessel that his ship
had been boarded by a French sail-of-the-line the day
before. Then he received a signal from a passing ship
that the enemy was at Trinidad, where he anchored
on the 7th June. Another report came to land that
on the 4th the enemy had been at Fort Royal and was
likely to sail during the night for the attack of Grenada.
He was at the latter island on the 9th, and heard that
the enemy had not only passed Dominica three days
before, “standing to the northward,” but had been
lucky enough to capture a convoy of ships laden with
sugar. Nelson peeped in at Montserrat on the 11th;
on the 13th the troops were being disembarked at St
John’s, Antigua, at which place the fleet had arrived
the previous evening. “At noon I sailed in my pursuit
of the enemy; and I do not yet despair of getting up
with them before they arrive at Cadiz or Toulon, to
which ports I think they are bound, or at least in time
to prevent them from having a moment’s superiority.
I have no reason to blame Dame Fortune. If either
General Brereton could not have wrote, or his look-out
man had been blind, nothing could have prevented
my fighting them on 6 June; but such information,
and from such a quarter, close to the enemy, could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
be doubted.” He had already sent a fast-sailing brig
with despatches to the Admiralty informing them of
the probable return of the combined fleet to Europe,
although so late as the 18th July he was not sure that
the enemy had not tricked him and gone to Jamaica.
With commendable alacrity Admiral Stirling was told
to form a junction with Sir Robert Calder off Ferrol,
and to await the enemy, for the commander of the
brig has sighted the quarry and was of opinion from
the course they were making that the neighbourhood of
Cape Finisterre was their desired haven. It has
remained for two modern historians to point out that
Nelson had discerned the likelihood of Ferrol as an
anchorage for Villeneuve’s fleet, and had forwarded a
warning to the Admiral stationed off that port.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>On the date just mentioned Nelson joined Collingwood
off Cadiz, but no accurate news awaited him.
Indeed, the former pinned his faith to an attack
on Ireland as the grand <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">finale</i> of Napoleon’s naval
manœuvres. At Gibraltar the Admiral went on shore
for the first time since the 16th June, 1803&mdash;over two
years. From thence he proceeded to Cornwallis’s
station off Ushant, and received orders from the Admiral
to sail with the <i>Victory</i> and the <i>Superb</i> for Spithead.
He struck his flag on the 19th August 1805 and set
off for Merton.</p>

<p>To what extent had Napoleon’s plans succeeded?
Villeneuve had reached Martinique on the 14th May,
only to find that Missiessy had not awaited his coming
according to instructions. Ganteaume was also unable
to carry out his part of the plan, consequently Villeneuve
was alone in the West Indies and might become Nelson’s
prey at any moment. The prospect did not please
him. When he heard that the great British commander
had not only arrived at Barbadoes but had been reinforced
by Cochrane he set the bows of his ships in the
direction of home, contrary to the Emperor’s orders
to wait for a stated period for Ganteaume’s arrival.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
So far from raiding the British West Indies, Villeneuve
only succeeded in capturing the Diamond Rock at
Martinique and Missiessy in taking Dominica, although
the latter had reinforced the French colonies.</p>

<p>After a perilous voyage Villeneuve was approaching
Ferrol in thick weather on the 22nd July when he came
face to face with the squadron of fifteen battleships
and four smaller vessels which had been sent by the
Admiralty to await his coming. The action which
followed was anything but decisive. The fleet Nelson
had longed to annihilate was allowed to escape by
Calder, whose only prizes were the Spanish <i>San Rafael</i>
(84) and <i>El Firme</i> (74). After leaving three of his
less seaworthy ships at Vigo, the French commander
eventually reached Coruña.</p>

</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the previous chapter we left Nelson at Portsmouth
after having chased the enemy nearly seven
thousand miles, and been absent from home
twenty-seven months. When “England’s darling”
set foot on the landing-stage he received an immense
ovation from the crowds of people who had assembled
to show their appreciation of his services. “It is
really quite affecting to see the wonder and admiration
and love and respect of the whole world,” writes Lord
Minto, referring to a mob in Piccadilly a little later,
“and the general expression of all these sentiments at
once, from gentle and simple, the moment he is seen.
It is beyond anything represented in a play or poem.”</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the man that, before leaving
his ship, he communicated with the Admiralty regarding
the companies of the <i>Victory</i> and the <i>Superb</i>. He said
they were in “most perfect health, and only require
some vegetables and other refreshments to remove
the scurvy.” Nelson at once proceeded to Merton,
where he lived in quiet retirement with Lady Hamilton,
playing with their beloved Horatia, or having a mental
tussle with the French as he walked the garden-paths
for hours without noticing either the passing of time
or the presence of fatigue. Perhaps he pondered over
the irony of Fate in giving the allied fleet into the hands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
of Calder, who had let the golden opportunity slip by
him so easily, but more probably he wondered if the
fickle goddess would yet allow him to break the yoke
of Napoleon on the seas.</p>

<p>The Emperor had made a final effort to unite his
scattered ships. When the combined fleet was on its
way to Europe the blockades of Rochefort and Ferrol
had been abandoned so that Calder might intercept
the enemy. He was but partially successful, as already
explained. The squadron of five sail-of-the-line at
Rochefort, commanded by Allemand, Missiessy’s successor,
had taken advantage of the temporary absence
of the British squadron and was making its way to
Vigo, where there were three sail.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Villeneuve had put
into Coruña with fifteen battle-ships, and found fourteen
Spanish and French sail-of-the-line awaiting him.
This brought the total of his available resources to
thirty-four sail, provided all were united. If Villeneuve
were able to join Ganteaume at Brest the number
would be fifty-five. Cornwallis, with either thirty-four
or thirty-five, was a dangerous menace, but when
that commander detached eighteen sail to blockade
Ferrol it did not seem insurmountable, even supposing
that the five ships under Calder, then stationed off Rochefort,
joined him, which they did on the 14th August.
After considerable delay Villeneuve weighed anchor
on the 13th August 1805, and hoped to reach Brest.
He encountered bad weather, mistook Allemand’s
ships for the enemy’s vessels, and, to make matters
worse, was informed that a large British fleet was on
the alert. With this he altered his course and put in
at Cadiz a week later. Here he was watched by Collingwood
with three sail-of-the-line and two smaller vessels,
until the latter was reinforced by twenty-two battleships,
four of which were under Sir Richard Bickerton
and the remainder under Calder. When Napoleon
heard of Villeneuve’s retirement to Cadiz he knew
that his gigantic exertions for the invasion of the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Kingdom had been completely shattered. With
marvellous facility he shifted his horizon from the
white cliffs of England to the wooded banks of the
Danube. The so-called Army of England was marched
from Boulogne to win fresh conquests in the Austerlitz
Campaign and to crush yet another coalition.</p>

<p>At five o’clock on the morning of the 2nd September
1805, Captain Blackwood presented himself at Merton.
“I am sure you bring me news of the French and
Spanish fleets,” Nelson exclaimed in his eager, boyish
way, “and I think I shall yet have to beat them.”
Blackwood was the bearer of the important intelligence
that Villeneuve, largely augmented, was at Cadiz.
For a time it would appear as if Nelson hesitated, not
on his own account but because of those whom he loved.
His health was bad, he felt the country very restful
after his trying cruise, and he disliked to give Lady
Hamilton cause for further anxiety. He walked the
“quarter-deck” in his garden weighing the pros with
the cons, then set off for the Admiralty in Whitehall.</p>

<p>“I think I shall yet have to beat them.” His mistress
was apparently no less valiant, at least in her conversation.
“Nelson,” she is stated to have said,
“however we may lament your absence, offer your
services; they will be accepted, and you will gain
a quiet heart by it; you will have a glorious victory,
and then you may return here, and be happy.”</p>

<p>Eleven days after Captain Blackwood’s call Nelson
left Merton for ever. It was a fearful wrench, but he
was prepared to sacrifice everything to his King and
his country. The following night he wrote in his
Diary, little thinking that the outpourings of his spirit
would ever be revealed in the lurid light of publicity,
a prayer which shows very clearly that he had a premonition
he would never open its pages again under
the roof of Merton Place:</p>

<p>“May the great God, whom I adore, enable me to
fulfil the expectations of my Country; and if it is
His good pleasure that I should return, my thanks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
will never cease being offered up to the Throne of His
Mercy. If it is His good Providence to cut short my days
upon earth, I bow with the greatest submission, relying
that He will protect those so dear to me, that I may
leave behind. His will be done. Amen, Amen, Amen.”</p>

<p>The <i>Victory</i>, on which he hoisted his flag, had been
hastily patched up and put in fighting trim. As her
escort went the <i>Euryalus</i> frigate, joined later by the
<i>Ajax</i> and <i>Thunderer</i>.</p>

<p>Collingwood and Calder “sat tight” outside Cadiz
harbour with one eye on the enemy and the other
searching for signs of the British ships, for they had
heard that Nelson would be with them ere long. Later,
“my dear Coll” received further tidings by the <i>Euryalus</i>
requesting that “not only no salute may take place,
but also that no colours may be hoisted: for it is as
well not to proclaim to the enemy every ship which may
join the fleet.” The supreme modesty of Nelson stands
out clearly in the last words of the note: “I would not
have any salute, even if you are out of sight of land.”</p>

<p>The day before his forty-seventh birthday, Nelson
hove in sight of Cadiz and assumed command. On
the 29th the officers came to congratulate him.
“The reception I met with on joining the fleet,”
he declares, “caused the sweetest sensation of my life.
The officers who came on board to welcome my return,
forgot my rank as Commander-in-chief in the enthusiasm
with which they greeted me. As soon as these emotions
were past, I laid before them the plan I had previously
arranged for attacking the enemy; and it was not only
my pleasure to find it generally approved, but clearly
perceived and understood.” Again: “Some shed
tears, all approved,” he writes, “it was new, it was
singular, it was simple; and from Admirals downwards
it was repeated, ‘It must succeed if ever they will allow
us to get at them! You are, my Lord, surrounded
by friends whom you inspire with confidence.’”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> In
due course the complete plan of attack was issued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
On October 19th the signal, “The enemy are coming
out of port,” flew from the mastheads of the frigates
stationed to watch the goings-on in the harbour. Thirty-three
ships-of-the-line, with five frigates and two brigs,
had passed out by the following day. They were
certainly “painted ships,” with their vividly-coloured
hulls of red and black, yellow and black, and black and
white. Their mission was to support Napoleon’s army
in the south of Italy.</p>

<p>Once at sea the combined fleet sailed in two divisions,
as had been agreed upon by Villeneuve and Gravina,
the commander of the Spanish vessels. The French
Admiral’s own squadron, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Corps de bataille</i>, was
made up of twenty-one sail-of-the-line, the centre
under Villeneuve himself, the van under Alava, and
the rear under Dumanoir. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Corps de réserve</i>, or
Squadron of Observation, consisted of twelve ships
divided into two squadrons of equal strength, each commanded
by Gravina and Magon respectively. The
duty of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Corps de réserve</i> was to watch the battle and
to reinforce any weak point as opportunity occurred.</p>

<p>Nelson’s force consisted of twenty-seven men-o’-war,
four frigates, a schooner, and a cutter. The enemy,
therefore, had the advantage as regards heavy ships, of
six sail-of-the-line. In armament the combatants were
nearly equal,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> as in bravery and daring, but very inferior
in seamanship and general <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morale</i>. It was very
necessary to prevent the enemy from entering the
Mediterranean, as Napoleon’s orders strictly enjoined
them to do, therefore the signal was made for a “general
chase S.E.,” namely, towards the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Napoleon had resolved to supersede Villeneuve by
Rosily. This decision probably carried more weight
with the French Admiral than any other, and had
determined his course of action, although at a council
of war, held before anchors were weighed, a resolution
was passed to avoid an engagement with the
British if possible. Of personal courage he had no lack,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
for he wrote to Decrès, the Minister of Marine, “if
the French navy has been deficient in nothing but
courage, as it is alleged, the Emperor shall soon be
satisfied, and he may reckon upon the most splendid
success.” His great hope was that he might elude
detection and land the troops he had on board at Naples.
He was without faith in his ships.</p>

<p>Having seen that his orders were carried out, Nelson
went to his cabin and began the last letter he was
destined to write to Lady Hamilton. Here it is in full:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest beloved Emma, the dear friend of

very little wind, so that I have no hopes of seeing them

care that my name shall ever be most dear to you and
Horatia, both of whom I love as much as my own life.

<p>“October 20th.&mdash;In the morning, we were close to
the Mouth of the Straits, but the wind had not come
far enough to the Westward to allow the Combined
Fleets to weather the Shoals of Trafalgar; but they
were counted as far as forty Sail of Ships of War, which
I suppose to be thirty-four of the Line, and six Frigates.
A group of them was seen off the Lighthouse of Cadiz
this morning, but it blows so very fresh and thick
weather, that I rather believe they will go into the
Harbour before night. May God Almighty give us
success over these fellows, and enable us to get a Peace.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After Trafalgar had been fought and won, the above
letter was found open on Nelson’s desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
The 20th was cold, damp, and miserable, but the
fleet had made good speed and was between Capes
Trafalgar and Spartel. By noon the <i>Victory</i> was within
eight or nine leagues of Cadiz.</p>

<p>Dr Beatty, surgeon of Nelson’s flagship, thus records
how the day was spent:</p>

<p>“At 8 o’clock in the morning of the 20th, the <i>Victory</i>
hove to, and Admiral Collingwood, with the captains
of the <i>Mars</i>, <i>Colossus</i>, and <i>Defence</i>, came on board to
receive instructions from his Lordship: at eleven
minutes past nine they returned to their respective
ships, and the fleet made sail again to the Northward.
In the afternoon the wind increased, and blew fresh
from the S.W., which excited much apprehension on
board the <i>Victory</i>, lest the enemy might be forced to
return to port. The look-out ships, however, made
several signals for seeing them, and to report their
force and bearings. His Lordship was at that time on
the poop; and turning round, and observing a group
of midshipmen assembled together, he said to them
with a smile, ‘This day, or to-morrow, will be a fortunate
one for you, young men,’ alluding to their being promoted
in the event of a victory. A little before sunset
the <i>Euryalus</i> communicated intelligence by telegraph<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
that ‘the enemy appeared determined to go to the
Westward.’ His Lordship, upon this, ordered it to
be signified to Captain Blackwood by signal, that ‘he
depended on the <i>Euryalus</i> for keeping sight of the
enemy during the night.’ The night signals were so
clearly and distinctly arranged by his Lordship, and
so well understood by the respective Captains, that the
enemy’s motions continued to be known to him with
the greatest facility throughout the night: a certain
number of guns with false fires and blue lights, announcing
their course, wearing and making or shortening
sail; and signals communicating such changes were
repeated by the look-out ships, from the <i>Euryalus</i> to
the <i>Victory</i>.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> 21st October 1805 is a red-letter day
in the history of England. Dawn had scarcely
succeeded night ere Nelson was up and
doing. He wore his Admiral’s frock-coat, the only
decoration being four stars of different Orders which
were pinned on his left breast. “In honour I gained
them,” he said, “and in honour I will die with them.”
He had not buckled on his sword, and this is the only
action he fought without it.</p>

<p>The previous night Villeneuve had signalled for the
columns of his fighting squadron to form in close line of
battle without regard to priority of place, his former
intention having been to give the three-deckers the
more important positions. Captain Lucas of the
<i>Redoutable</i> states that the ships “were all widely
scattered” in consequence of this order. “The ships
of the battle squadron and those of the squadron of
observation were all mixed up,” although the commanders
of the latter did their best to get into something
approaching order.</p>

<p>Early the following morning&mdash;the glorious 21st&mdash;the
French Admiral signalled to “clear for action!”
and in response to the <i>Hermione’s</i> message, “The enemy
number twenty-seven sail-of-the-line,” he ordered each
ship to leave but one cable’s length between its immediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
neighbour. They were now on the starboard
tack. Almost before these instructions had been
completely carried out Villeneuve decided to alter
their position, signalling them to form in line of battle
on the port tack. The manœuvre was not easily
effected. The wind was light, with a heavy swell,
many ships missed their station, and there were several
gaps and groups of ships along the line instead of
vessels at regular intervals. The newly-formed line
was consequently very irregular and almost crescent-shaped.
Villeneuve, prudent to a fault, wished to
have Cadiz harbour under his lee; he was apparently
already lending his mind to thoughts of disaster.</p>

<p>Gravina, with the twelve reserve ships, seems to have
pursued his own tactics. Instead of keeping to windward
of the line, so that he might bring succour to
Villeneuve if need should arise, the Vice-Admiral
“moved to the rear to prolong the line”&mdash;now extending
some five miles&mdash;“without having been signalled
to do so.” Whether Villeneuve took particular notice
of this false move at the time is uncertain, but later,
on his attempt to get his colleague to take up the
position previously arranged for him and which would
have enabled Gravina “to reinforce the centre of the
line against the attack of the enemy,” no attention was
paid to the command. Never was there a more fatal
error of policy. Had the Spanish Admiral been able
to bring twelve ships to bear upon the battle when it
was at its height he might have rendered valuable
assistance.</p>

<p>Scarcely less reprehensible was the behaviour of
Rear-Admiral Dumanoir Le Pelley, who with ten ships fell
to leeward and formed a rear squadron.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Not until it was
too late did he attempt to take any part in the battle.</p>

<p>The British fleet was formed into two columns,
eleven ships following the <i>Victory</i> (100), and fourteen
in the rear of the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> (100), under Collingwood.
Nelson’s idea was to bear down upon the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
with these two divisions and break the centre of the
combined fleet in two places at once, Nelson leading
the weather line, and Collingwood the lee. While
Villeneuve was issuing his last order before the struggle,
“Every ship which is not in action is not at its post,”
the British Commander-in-chief was committing to paper
the following prayer:</p>

<p>“May the great God whom I worship grant to my
country and for the benefit of Europe in general a
great and glorious victory, and may no misconduct
in anyone tarnish it; and may humanity after victory
be the predominant feature in the British fleet! For
myself individually, I commit my life to Him that
made me, and may His blessing alight on my endeavours
for serving my country faithfully. To Him I resign
myself and the just cause which is entrusted me to
defend.”</p>

<p>Nelson also made his will, heading it, “October
21st 1805, then in sight of the Combined Fleets of
France and Spain, distant about ten miles.” Blackwood
and Hardy attached their signatures as witnesses.
He left Emma, Lady Hamilton, “a legacy to my King
and country, that they will give her an ample provision
to maintain her rank in life. I also leave to the beneficence
of my country my adopted daughter, Horatia
Nelson Thompson; and I desire she will use in future
the name of Nelson only.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Hoisting the Famous Signal</p>

<p class="notbold">C.&nbsp;M. Padday</p></div></div>

<p>Blackwood had gone on board the flag-ship at six
o’clock in the morning, and found the admiral “in
good, but very calm spirits.” He tells us in his
“Memoirs” that “during the five hours and a half
that I remained on board the <i>Victory</i>, in which I was
not ten minutes from his side, he frequently asked
me, ‘What I should consider a victory?’ the certainty
of which he never for an instant seemed to doubt,
although, from the situation of the land, he questioned
the possibility of the subsequent preservation of the
prizes. My answer was, that considering the handsome
way in which battle was offered by the enemy, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
apparent determination for a fair trial of strength,
and the proximity of the land, I thought if fourteen
ships were captured, it would be a glorious result;
to which he always replied, ‘I shall not, Blackwood,
be satisfied with anything short of twenty.’ A telegraphic
signal had been made by him to denote, ‘that
he intended to break through the rear of the enemy’s
line, to prevent them getting into Cadiz.’ I was
walking with him on the poop, when he said, ‘I’ll
now amuse the fleet with a signal;’ and he asked me
‘if I did not think there was one yet wanting?’ I
answered, that I thought the whole of the fleet seemed
very clearly to understand what they were about,
and to vie with each other who should first get nearest
to the <i>Victory</i> or <i>Royal Sovereign</i>. These words were
scarcely uttered, when his last well-known signal was
made, ‘<span class="smcap">England expects every man will do his
duty</span>.’ The shout with which it was received throughout
the fleet was truly sublime. ‘Now,’ said Lord
Nelson, ‘I can do no more. We must trust to the
Great Disposer of all events, and justice of our cause.
I thank God for this great opportunity of doing my
duty.’”</p>

<p>It has been pointed out that Blackwood is wrong
in the matter of the cheer “throughout the fleet,” for
several of the crews were not informed as to the purport
of the signal. The Admiral’s first idea was to flag
“Nelson confides that every man will do his duty.”
Captain Blackwood suggested “England” in place of
“Nelson,” which the Admiral told Pasco, the signal officer,
to hoist, adding that he “must be quick” as he had
“one more signal to make, which is for close action.”</p>

<p>“Then, your Lordship,” ventured Pasco, “if you
will permit me to substitute ‘expects’ for ‘confides’
the signal can be more quickly completed, because
we have ‘expects’ in the vocabulary, while ‘confides’
must be spelled.” The code-book therefore won the
day, and a message which has inspired the Navy for
over a century was soon floating on the breeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
In this connection there is a tradition that a Scottish
sailor complained to a fellow-countryman: “Not a
word o’ puir auld Scotland.” “Hoots, Sandy,” answered
his comrade, “the Admiral kens that every Scotsman
will do his duty. He’s just giving the Englishers
a hint.”</p>

<p>To continue Blackwood’s narrative: “The wind
was light from the S.W., and a long swell was setting
into the Bay of Cadiz, so that our ships, like sovereigns
of the ocean, moved majestically before it; every one
crowding all the sail that was possible, and falling into
her station according to her rate of going. The enemy
wore at about seven o’clock, and then stood in a close
line on the larboard tack towards Cadiz. At that
time the sun shone bright on their sails; and from the
number of three-deckers amongst them, they made
a most formidable appearance; but this, so far from
appalling our brave countrymen, induced them to
observe to each other, ‘what a fine sight those ships
would make at Spithead.’<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> About ten o’clock, Lord
Nelson’s anxiety to close with the enemy became very
apparent. He frequently remarked to me, that they
put a good face upon it; but always quickly added,
‘I’ll give them such a dressing as they never had before,’
regretting at the same time the vicinity of the land.
At that critical moment I ventured to represent to
his lordship the value of such a life as his, and particularly
in the present battle; and I proposed hoisting
his flag in the <i>Euryalus</i>, whence he could better see
what was going on, as well as what to order in case of
necessity. But he would not hear of it, and gave as
his reason the force of example; and probably he was
right.”</p>

<p>A sailor who rejoiced in the nickname of Jack Nasty-Face
gives us an excellent view of the proceedings as
the sail-of-the-line were got ready for action: “During
this time each ship was making the usual preparations,
such as breaking away the captain and officers’ cabins,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
and sending the lumber below&mdash;the doctors, parson,
purser, and loblolly men were also busy, getting the
medicine chests and bandages and sails prepared for
the wounded to be placed on, that they might be
dressed in rotation as they were taken down to the
after-cockpit. In such bustling, and, it may be said,
trying as well as serious time, it is curious to notice
the different dispositions of the British sailor. Some
would be offering a guinea for a glass of grog, while
others were making a sort of mutual verbal will&mdash;such
as, if one of Johnny Crapeau’s shots (a term given to
the French) knocks my head off, you will take all my
effects; and if you are killed, and I am not, why, I
will have yours; and this is generally agreed to....”</p>

<p>Another intimate word-picture of what happened
just before the contest of giants began is furnished by
General Sir S.&nbsp;B. Ellis, K.C.B., who was a second
lieutenant of Marines in the <i>Ajax</i>. “I was sent below
with orders,” he writes, “and was much struck with
the preparations made by the bluejackets, the majority
of whom were stripped to the waist; a handkerchief
was tightly bound round their heads and over the
eyes, to deaden the noise of the cannon, many men
being deaf for days after an action. The men were
variously occupied; some were sharpening their
cutlasses, others polishing the guns, as though an
inspection were about to take place instead of a mortal
combat, whilst three or four, as if in mere bravado,
were dancing a hornpipe; but all seemed deeply anxious
to come to close quarters with the enemy. Occasionally
they would look out of the ports, and speculate as to
the various ships of the enemy, many of which had
been on former occasions engaged by our vessels.”</p>

<p>At about noon the first shot was fired. It came
from the <i>Fougueux</i>, a French ship of 74 guns, under
the command of Captain Louis Baudoin.</p>

<p>The <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, with the <i>Belleisle</i> (74), <i>Mars</i>
(74), and <i>Tonnant</i> (80) just behind her, forged ahead.
Nelson had signalled Collingwood to break the enemy’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
line at the twelfth ship from the rear, but on seeing
that she was only a two-decker Collingwood changed
his course and steered straight for the <i>Santa Ana</i>,
a huge Spanish ship of 112 guns, commanded by Vice-Admiral
Alava. The <i>Fougueux</i> (74) then came up and
endeavoured to prevent Collingwood from getting
through the line. This caused the English Admiral
to order his captain to make a target of the bowsprit
of the Frenchman and steer straight for it. Fortunately
for the enemy she altered her course, but although
she saved herself she did not prevent the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>
from breaking the line.</p>

<p>Collingwood was in his element; his usual silent
ways gave place to enthusiasm. “What would Nelson
give to be here!” he observed, the while his double-shotted
guns were hurling death into the hold of his
adversary and raking her fore and aft. A broadside
and a half tore down the huge stern gallery of the <i>Santa
Ana</i> (112), and killed and wounded a number of her
crew, all of whom showed by deed and daring that
they were worthy of their famous ancestors.</p>

<p>Both ships were soon in a pitiable condition, but
they hugged each other in a last desperate struggle.
A terrific cannonade ensued, the <i>Fougueux</i> and the
<i>San Leandro</i> (64) raking the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, and the
<i>San Justo</i> (74) and <i>Indomptable</i> (80) lending their
assistance some distance away, although it was difficult
for them to distinguish between the two chief contestants,
so dense was the smoke from the guns. Some
fifteen or twenty minutes after Collingwood had maintained
the unequal contest alone, several British ships
came up and paid attention to those of the enemy
which had gone to Alava’s assistance. At about a
quarter past two the mammoth <i>Santa Ana</i> struck
her flag. On the captain delivering up his sword as
deputy for the Vice-Admiral, who lay dreadfully
wounded, he remarked that he thought the conquering
vessel should be called the <i>Royal Devil</i>!</p>

<p>Nelson, steering two points more to the north than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Collingwood, so as to cut off the enemy’s way of retreat
to Cadiz, came up about half an hour after the latter
had begun his engagement. As the stately flagship
entered the zone of fire a number of Villeneuve’s vessels
poured a perfect avalanche of shot upon her decks.
Down went a score or more of brave fellows, the wheel
was smashed, necessitating the ship being steered in the
gun-room, and a topmast dropped on the deck from
aloft. A shot struck one of the launches, a splinter
tearing a buckle from one of the shoes of either Nelson
or Hardy, which is not quite clear. “They both,”
writes Doctor Beatty, in his “Narrative,” “instantly
stopped, and were observed by the officers on deck to
survey each other with inquiring looks, each supposing
the other to be wounded. His Lordship then
smiled and said, ‘This is too warm work, Hardy, to
last long’; and declared that, through all the battles
he had been in, he had never witnessed more cool
courage than was displayed by the <i>Victory’s</i> crew on
this occasion.”</p>

<p>Steering for the <i>Santissima Trinidad</i> (130), at that
time the biggest floating arsenal ever built in Europe,
Nelson sought to engage her, but an alteration in
position precluded this, and he tackled the <i>Bucentaure</i>
(80), Villeneuve’s flagship. The French Admiral was
at last face to face with the man whose spirit had haunted
him since he assumed command.</p>

<p>Crash went the 68-pounder carronade into the
80-gun Frenchman, and down came the greater
part of the <i>Bucentaure’s</i> stern. The <i>Victory</i> then
grappled with the <i>Redoutable</i>, at the same time
receiving a hurricane of fire from the French <i>Neptuno</i>
(80).</p>

<p>Up in the fighting-tops of the <i>Redoutable</i> (74) were
riflemen trying to pick off the officers of the <i>Victory</i>.
One marksman, a little keener sighted or more fortunately
placed than the others, saw Nelson walking up
and down with Hardy. There was a flash of fire,
a sharp crack as the bullet sped through the air, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
the master mariner of England, of the world, of all
time, fell in a heap upon the deck.</p>

<p>The fatal ball entered his left shoulder by the edge
of the epaulet, cut through the spine, and finally buried
itself in the muscles of the back.</p>

<p>Three fellows rushed forward to his assistance.</p>

<p>“They have done for me at last, Hardy,” he murmured,
as they carried him below.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” was the Captain’s reply, not knowing
the extent of Nelson’s injuries, and probably thinking
that it might be possible to remove the missile.</p>

<p>“Yes, my backbone is shot through,” and then
Nelson placed a handkerchief over his face that the
crew might not know who formed the central figure of
the solemn little procession. Some sailors on the
<i>Santissima Trinidad</i>, however, could see from the
stars on his coat that an important officer had fallen,
and cheered.</p>

<p>They laid him in a midshipman’s berth in the dimly-lit
cockpit. He looked into the face of Death as he
had looked into the face of the enemy, without flinching
but not without hope. Sometimes a sentence would
escape his lips. “Ah, Mr Beatty,” he said to the
surgeon, “you can do nothing for me; my back is
shot through,” and to Dr Scott, the chaplain, “Doctor,
I am gone: I have to leave Lady Hamilton and my
daughter Horatia as a legacy to my country.”</p>

<p>Very little relief could be afforded him. He sipped
lemonade frequently, his breast was rubbed, and constant
fanning helped to soothe his agonies a little.
Nelson sent for Hardy, whom he valued as an able
officer and friend, but as the Captain could not leave
his post at once the dying man feared for his safety.
“Will no one bring Hardy to me? He must be
killed! He is surely dead!”</p>

<p>The cheers of the British tars were borne down
to the cockpit as often as an enemy’s ship struck
her flag, and a smile played over the pallid
features. At last Hardy appeared and took his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
chief’s hand. “How goes the day with us?” was the
eager question.</p>

<p>“Very well, my Lord. We have taken twelve or
fourteen ships; but five of their van have tacked and
mean to bear down on us; but I have called two or
three of our fresh ships round, and have no doubt of
giving them a drubbing.”</p>

<p>“I hope none of <em>our</em> ships have struck?” Nelson
hastened to ask, seeing that Hardy was anxious to
return to his post.</p>

<p>“There is no fear of that,” was the reassuring answer.</p>

<p>Hardy, unable to restrain his tears, ascended the
companion ladder. As the guns were fired into the
passing squadron of Rear-Admiral Dumanoir, the ship
shook violently, thereby causing the dying man intense
agony. “Oh, <i>Victory</i>, <i>Victory</i>,” he cried, “how you
distract my poor brain,” followed by “how dear is
life to all men.” Then his wandering thoughts turned
homeward, and the memory of happy hours at Merton
made him add, “Yet one would like to live a little
longer, too.” Hardy again entered the cockpit with
the good news that fourteen or fifteen ships had struck.
“That is well,” Nelson breathed, “but I bargained
for twenty. Anchor, Hardy, anchor.” The Captain
then asked whether Collingwood should not take the
post of Commander-in-chief. The Admiral answered
with all the force he could muster, “Not whilst I live,
Hardy&mdash;no other man shall command whilst I live.
Anchor, Hardy, anchor; if I live I’ll anchor.”</p>

<p>Nelson was sinking: the moment for taking his
long farewell of his Captain had come. “Don’t throw
me overboard, Hardy. Take care of my dear Lady
Hamilton; take care of poor Lady Hamilton. Kiss
me, Hardy.” As the sorrowful officer bent over him
consciousness began to fade. “Who is that?” he
asked. On being told that it was Hardy, he whispered,
“God bless you, Hardy.”</p>

<p>His life flickered like the candle fixed on the beam
above, and then slowly went out. He murmured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
that he wished he had not left the deck, that he had
<em>not</em> been a <em>great</em> sinner, and said with deliberation,
“Thank God, I have done my duty.” “God and my
country” were the last words heard by the sorrowful
little group gathered round their beloved master. In
the arms of Mr Walter Burke, the purser of the ship,
Nelson lay dead.</p>

<p>And above, the heavy guns thundered a funeral
dirge.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, the <i>Victory</i> was engaged
in a duel with the <i>Redoutable</i> when Nelson received
his death wound. For a short period the Frenchman
did not return the fire, and thinking that Captain
Lucas was about to surrender, the <i>Victory’s</i> guns also
kept silence. But the interval had been used for
another purpose. The French crew were swarming
over the bulwarks of the British flagship, climbing
chains, and even clambering over the anchor in their
attempt to get on board. A desperate resistance was
offered, Captain Adair was killed by a musket ball, as
well as eighteen marines and twenty seamen.</p>

<p>Help came from a sister ship. The <i>Téméraire</i> (98)&mdash;the
fighting <i>Téméraire</i> of Turner’s glorious picture&mdash;was
now astern of the <i>Redoutable</i>. Had she possessed
the machine guns of to-day she could hardly have
swept the decks of the enemy with more deadly effect.
The men who were attempting to board went down
like ninepins. The carnage was awful; the sight
sickening. When the smoke cleared, little heaps of
corpses were seen piled up on the decks, while the
bodies of other poor fellows floated on the sea, now
tinged with the blood of victor and vanquished. Five
hundred and twenty-two of the <i>Redoutable’s</i> crew fell
that day before she struck her colours.</p>

<p>The <i>Bucentaure</i> and the <i>Santissima Trinidad</i> were
together throughout the battle and received a succession
of attacks from various ships until they surrendered.
Both of them were then little more than dismasted
hulks. Villeneuve fought with the strength of despair,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
but the case was hopeless, and resistance only prolonged
the agony. No assistance came to him despite his
frantic efforts to attract attention. “My part in the
<i>Bucentaure</i> is finished!” he cried at last, and so the
gallant but weak-willed officer was taken.</p>

<p>In appearance Villeneuve was “a tallish, thin man,
a very tranquil, placid, English-looking Frenchman;
he wore a long-tailed uniform coat, high and flat collar,
corduroy pantaloons of a greenish colour, with stripes
two inches wide, half-boots with sharp toes, and a
watch-chain with long gold links.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>Other ships surrendered as the day wore on, the
<i>Algéçiras</i> (74) to the <i>Tonnant</i> (80), the <i>Swiftsure</i> (74)
and the <i>Bahama</i> (74) to the <i>Colossus</i> (74), the <i>San Juan
Nepomuceno</i> (74) to the <i>Dreadnought</i> (98). Eighteen
ships of the Allied Fleet were captured; one, the
<i>Achille</i> (74), blew up with a terrific explosion.</p>

<p>The <i>Victory</i> had been roughly handled by her
adversaries. In Hardy’s report of the 5th December
1805, he says:</p>

<p>“The hull is much damaged by shot in a number of
different places, particularly in the wales, strings, and
spurketing, and some between wind and water. Several
beams, knees, and riders, shot through and broke;
the starboard cathead shot away; the rails and timbers
of the head and stem cut by shot, and the falling of
the mizen-mast; the principal part of the bulkheads,
halfports, and portsashes thrown overboard in clearing
ship for action.</p>

<p>“The mizen-mast shot away about 9 feet above the
deck; the main-mast shot through and sprung; the
main-yard gone; the main-topmast and cap shot in
different places and reefed; the main-topsail yard shot
away; the foremast shot through in a number of
different places, and is at present supported by a topmast,
and a part of the topsail and crossjack yards;
the fore-yard shot away; the bowsprit jibboom and
cap shot, and the spritsail and spritsail topsail yards,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
and flying jibboom gone; the fore and main-tops
damaged; the whole of the spare topmast yards,
handmast, and fishes in different places, and converted
into jury geer.</p>

<p>“The ship makes in bad weather 12 inches water
an hour.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>At five o’clock Gravina made the signal for retreat.
What a sorry lot they were, those eleven ships&mdash;six
Spanish and five French&mdash;which with their consorts
had attempted to dethrone the Mistress of the Seas.
Another four under the command of Dumanoir had
also made good their escape, but only to be captured
off Cape Ortegal on November 4th, by Sir Richard
Strachan.</p>

<p>An eye-witness on board the <i>Belleisle</i> graphically
describes the scene after the last shot had been fired:
“The view of the fleet at this period was highly interesting,
and would have formed a beautiful subject for
a painter. Just under the setting rays were five or six
dismantled prizes; on one hand lay the <i>Victory</i> with
part of our fleet and prizes, and on the left hand the
<i>Royal Sovereign</i> and a similar cluster of ships. To the
northward, the remnant of the combined fleets was
making for Cadiz. The <i>Achille</i>, with the tricoloured
ensign still displayed, had burnt to the water’s edge
about a mile from us, and our tenders and boats were
using every effort to save the brave fellows who had so
gloriously defended her; but only two hundred and
fifty were rescued, and she blew up with a tremendous
explosion.”</p>

<p>The battle was over, but much yet remained to be
done. Eighteen sail-of-the-line of the Allied Fleet
had struck their flag, and it was Collingwood’s difficult
task to secure the prizes. “A continued series of misfortunes,”
to use the Admiral’s own words, “... of
a kind that human prudence could not possibly
provide against, or my skill prevent,” alone precluded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
him from keeping more than four trophies of
Trafalgar.</p>

<p>“On the 22nd, in the morning,” he states in a despatch
to the Admiralty, “a strong southerly wind
blew, with squally weather, which, however, did not
prevent the activity of the officers and seamen of such
ships as were manageable from getting hold of many of
the prizes (thirteen or fourteen), and towing them off
to the westward, where I ordered them to rendezvous
round the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, in tow by the <i>Neptune</i>. But
on the 23rd the gale increased, and the sea ran so high
that many of them broke the tow-rope, and drifted
far to leeward before they were got hold of again;
and some of them, taking advantage of the dark and
boisterous night, got before the wind, and have perhaps
drifted upon the shore and sunk. On the afternoon
of that day, the remnant of the combined fleet, ten
sail of ships,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> which had not been much engaged, stood
up to leeward of my shattered and straggling charge,
as if meaning to attack them, which obliged me to
collect a force out of the least injured ships, and form
to leeward for their defence. All this retarded the
progress of the hulks; and the bad weather continuing,
determined me to destroy all the leewardmost that
could be cleared of the men, considering that keeping
possession of the ships was a matter of little consequence,
compared with the chance of their falling again into
the hands of the enemy; but even this was an arduous
task in the high sea which was running. I hope, however,
it has been accomplished to a considerable extent.
I intrusted it to skilful officers, who would spare no
pains to execute what was possible. The Captains of
the <i>Prince</i> and <i>Neptune</i> cleared the <i>Trinidad</i>, and sunk
her. Captains Hope, Bayntun, and Malcolm, who
joined the fleet this morning, from Gibraltar, had the
charge of destroying four others. The <i>Redoutable</i>
sunk astern of the <i>Swiftsure</i>, while in tow. The <i>Santa
Ana</i> I have no doubt is sunk, as her side is almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
entirely beat in; and such is the shattered condition
of the whole of them, that, unless the weather moderates,
I doubt whether I shall be able to carry a ship of them
into port....”</p>

<p>In a later letter Collingwood says, “There never was
such a combat since England had a fleet.” Three of
the prizes, the <i>Santa Ana</i>, the <i>Neptuno</i>, and the <i>Algéçiras</i>
escaped in the gale and entered Cadiz harbour, the
former two having been retaken by Cosmao Kerjulien,
who lost three ships over the transaction. The <i>Swiftsure</i>
(French), the <i>San Ildefonso</i>, the <i>San Juan Nepomuceno</i>,
and the <i>Bahama</i> were the only Trafalgar prizes
saved; these were taken to Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Villeneuve was sent to England and afterwards
exchanged, Alava was fortunate enough to reach Cadiz
on board the shattered <i>Santa Ana</i>. Although severely
wounded, he recovered and lived for many years.
Cisneros, after a gallant resistance, also escaped, and
was promoted Vice-Admiral in return for his distinguished
services, later taking up the important positions
of Captain-General and Minister of Marine. Magon,
who fought his flagship the <i>Algéçiras</i> until he was
struck dead after receiving several wounds, is one of
the most glorious names in the naval annals of France.
Three officers in turn were dangerously wounded before
the tattered flag of the battered hulk was finally lowered.
Of the other admirals, Cosmao retook the <i>Santa Ana</i>
and the <i>Neptuno</i>, already noted, Dumanoir was court-martialed,
and Gravina succumbed to his wounds as
these words formed themselves on his almost nerveless
lips: “I am a dying man, but I die happy; I am
going, I hope and trust, to join Nelson, the greatest
hero that the world perhaps has produced.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Escano
was injured in the leg, but reached Spain safely.
Napoleon’s officers paid dearly for the fight in Trafalgar
Bay, but Villeneuve was the scapegoat of Napoleon’s
ambition. On his return to France he took his own
life.</p>

Collingwood gave the number of prisoners as 20,000,
and the monetary loss of the enemy nearly £4,000,000,
“most of it gone to the bottom.” The British loss
was 1690 killed and wounded; that of the allies 5860,
although no exact figures are obtainable. The captives
were taken to England, and the officers allowed on
parole, but the seamen and soldiers of the extinguished
Allied Fleet were sent to the prisons of Porchester,
Forton, Weedon, Norman Cross, Mill Bay, and Stapleton,
locked up in local gaols, or interned in hulks. By a
cruel fate the <i>Bahama</i> and the <i>Swiftsure</i> were added to
the number of the latter. Few exchanges were made,
and so the poor fellows either died in exile or remained
until the downfall of Napoleon secured them liberty.</p>

<p>Thus ended the battle of Trafalgar&mdash;Napoleon’s
maritime Waterloo. The idea of a great military
commander conducting operations at sea was proved to
be impracticable, while the superior qualities of British
seamanship were once more evident. The method of
warfare practised by the combined fleet, that of aiming
at the rigging and picking off combatants by sharp-shooting,
was less successful than our own principle
of aiming at the vital parts of the hull. Whereas the
British succeeded in firing a gun nearly once a minute,
it took three minutes for the Allied Fleet to do so. The
total armament on the English vessels numbered 2148
guns, while the French had 1356, and the Spanish
1270, bringing the combined force to 2626.</p>

<p>Great Britain gained enormously in prestige as a
result of Nelson’s overwhelming victory. Amongst
other important consequences Trafalgar led Napoleon
to enforce his disastrous Continental System, by means
of which he hoped to exclude from the Continent the
goods of his persistent enemy. This, in its turn, brought
on the war with Russia, a big step towards the final
catastrophe of Waterloo.</p>

<p>More than two weeks passed before the people of
England received certain intelligence of the great rout
of the enemy in Trafalgar Bay. On the 6th November<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
1805, guns at the Tower and elsewhere announced the
victory, and the glad tidings flashed through the length
and breadth of the <span class="locked">land&mdash;</span></p>

<p>But, alas! the idol of the nation lay dead in the
keeping of his comrades and sorrowing England could
never again greet in life the son who had loved her
so well.</p>

<p>Nelson had touched the imagination of high and low,
and only the sad circumstance of an early death in
the moment of glorious victory was wanted to ensure
him the proudest place in all the long annals of British
naval history.</p>

<p>Mr William Canton has written an exquisite poem<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>
which well expresses the mingled feelings of elation and
grief with which the nation received the great news.
He imagines a “glittering autumn morning” in Chester,
the Cathedral bells clashing a jubilant peal for the
victory. But while yet the air is filled with the glad
tongues of the joy-bells&mdash;</p>

<p>After Nelson’s remains had been embalmed at Gibraltar
they were conveyed in the <i>Victory</i> to Portsmouth,
which was reached on the 2nd December 1805.
In the early days of the New Year there was a lying-in-state
in the beautiful Painted Hall of Greenwich
Hospital, but comparatively few of the many thousands
of people who wished to pay a last tribute of respect
to the Admiral’s memory were able to do so. The
coffin, made out of the mainmast of the famous <i>l’Orient</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
which blew up at the Nile, enclosed in an outer case,
was then removed to the Admiralty, where it remained
until the 9th January 1806, the day of the public
funeral. The Prince of Wales, Dukes of the realm,
prelates, statesmen, admirals, aristocrats and plebeians
crowded into St Paul’s Cathedral, a fitting shrine for
the dust of the greatest sailor of the <span class="locked">country&mdash;</span></p>

<p>An Earldom was conferred upon the Rev. William
Nelson, a large sum of money was voted by Parliament
for the purchase of an estate to be named after Trafalgar,
and certain monies were given to the dead Admiral’s
two sisters. By such means the country sought to
discharge its heavy debt to the glorious memory of
Nelson. Nothing was done for Lady Hamilton, and
although, at the time of Nelson’s death, her income
amounted to about £2000 a year she died in very reduced
circumstances at Calais in the year of Waterloo. Her
daughter, and in all probability Nelson’s, was married
on the 24th February 1822 at Burnham, Norfolk, to
the Rev. Phillip Ward, M.A. She is described as both
witty and fascinating, and her portrait by Sir William
Charles Ross makes one believe that she was so.</p>

<p>More than a century has passed since the great
battle was fought “in Trafalgar’s Bay,” but the memory
of the little, one-eyed, one-armed man is still treasured
by those who believe, as he believed, that the strength
of Great Britain rests upon her command of the sea.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
